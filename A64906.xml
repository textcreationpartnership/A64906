            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the people in times paſt, it was common, to praiſe and extoll by Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and Epigrams, the famous deeds of all ſuch perſons, whoſoever in any vertuous quality or Liberall Science excelled. <hi>Sulpitius Gallus</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> was highly renowned for his ſingular cunning in <hi>Aſtronomie,</hi> by whoſe meanes <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Paulus</hi> obtained the victory in this Warres againſt <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius.

               <hi>luba,</hi> Kings of famous memory, who purchaſed Eternal praiſe, by their ſtudy and cunning in Phyſicke and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie. But now in theſe our dayes Envie ſo ruleth the roast, that Phyſicke ſhould be condemned, and Surgerie deſpiſed for ever, but that ſometimes paine biddeth Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and care keepeth skirmiſh in ſuch bitter fort, that at the laſt his Alarum is ſounded out; Now come Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, and then helpe Surgerie. Then is remembred the ſaying of IESVS the Son of SYRACH, which is notable, <hi>Honour the Phyſitian and Chyrurgion for neceſſity;</hi> whom the Almighty God hath created, becauſe from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt commeth Medicine, and they ſhall receive gifts of the King. Wherefore we exhort the wiſe man, that hee in no time of Proſperity and Health, neglect thoſe noble Arts and Miſteries of <hi>Phyſicke</hi> and <hi>Chyrurgerie,</hi> becauſe no Age, no Perſon, no Country, can long time lacke their helpes and Remedies. What is it to have Lands and Houſes, to abound in Silver and Gold, to be deckt with Pearles and Diamonds, yea, and to rule over Nations and Countries, and to lacke Health, the onely Iewell and greateſt treaſure of mans life and delight? Conſider then (we beſeech your Worſhips) what praiſes are due
<pb facs="tcp:99028:3"/>to ſuch noble Sciences, which onely worke the cauſes of this aforeſaid Health, and how much the Weale-pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like are bound to all them, whoſe cares and Studies dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tendeth to this end. Amongſt whom here is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, Mr. VICARY Eſquire, Sergeant Chyrurgion to two Kings and two Queenes of famous memory: whoſe learned worke of <hi>Anatomie,</hi> is by vs (the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Surgions of St. Bartholmewes in weſt Smithfield,</hi> newly revived, corrected, and publiſhed abroad to the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of others) who be Students in <hi>Chyrurgerie:</hi> not without our great ſtudy, paines and charges. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee doe lacke the profound knowledge, and ſugred Eloquence of the <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> tongues, to decke and beautifie this worke, yet we hope the ſtudious Reader ſhall thereby reape ſingular commodity and profit, by reading this little Treatiſe of the <hi>Anatomie of Mans Body;</hi> the which is onely grounded vpon Reaſon and Experience, which are two principall rootes of Phyſicke and Chyrurgerie. As it is granted by <hi>Galen,</hi> in his third Booke <hi>De Methodo medendi.</hi> And we who dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worke and practiſe in Chyrurgerie, according to the deepeneſſe of the Art, as well in grievous Wounds, Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and Fiſtulaes, as other hid and ſecret diſeaſes vpon the Body of Man, daily vſed by us in St. <hi>Bartholmewes</hi> Hoſpitall, and other places, &amp;c. Theſe poore and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Creatures, as well Men, and Women, as Children, doe know the profit of this Art to be manifold, and the lacke of the ſame to be lamented. Therefore <hi>Galen</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writeth, ſaying: That no man can worke ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as aforeſayd, without the knowledge of the <hi>Anatomie:</hi> For (ſayth he) It is as poſſible for a Blind man to carve
<pb facs="tcp:99028:4"/>and make an Image perfect, as a Chyrurgion to worke without error in a Mans body not knowing the <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</hi> And further, for as much, as your Worſhips are very carefull for thoſe poore and grieved Creatures within the Hoſpitall of St. <hi>Bartholmewes, &amp;c.</hi> whereof Mr. VICARY was a member. Wee are therefore now the more incouraged to dedicate this little worke of the <hi>Anatomie,</hi> being his and our Travels, to you as Patrons of this Booke, to defend it againſt the ravenous jawes of Envious Backbiters, which never ceaſe by all unlawfull meanes, to blemiſh and deface the workes of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Expert, and well diſpoſed perſons. And wee ſhall not onely thanke your Worſhips for ſo doing, but alſo pray unto Almighty GOD to requite your goodneſſe, and receive you into his protection and keeping.</p>

            <head>A TREASVRE FOR ENGLISH-MEN. <hi>Containing the Anatomie of mans body:</hi> Compiled by <hi>Thomas Vicary</hi> Eſquire, and Sergeant Chyrurgion to King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. to King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. to Qu. <hi>Mary,</hi> and to our late gracious Soveraigne Lady, Queene ELIZABETH.

            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I. Heere I ſhall declare unto you ſhortly and briefly, the ſayings and determinations of divers ancient Authors in three Points, very expedient for all men to know, that intend to uſe and exerciſe the Myſterie or Art of Chyururgerie. The firſt is, to know what Chyrurgerie is: The ſecond is, how that a Chyrurgion ſhould bee choſen: And the third is, with what properties a Chyrurgion ſhould be indued.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or the firſt, which is to know what thing Chyrurgeris is. Herein I doe note the ſaying of <hi>Lanfranke,</hi> whereas hée ſayth: All things that man would know, may be knowne by one of theſe thrée things: That is to ſay, by his Name, or by his Working; or elſe by his very being and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99028:7"/>ſhewing of his owne properties. So then it followeth that in the ſame manner we may know what Chyrurgery is, by thrée things. Firſt, by his Name, as thus: the Interpreters write that Chirurgery is derived out of theſe words, <hi>Apo tes chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros, ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> touergou,</hi> that is to be vnderſtood: a hand working, and ſo it may be taken for all handy Artes: But Noble <hi>Ipocras</hi> ſaith, that Chirurgerie is hand-working in Mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for the very end and profit of Chirurgerie is hand-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
               <p>Now the ſecond manner of knowing what thing Chyrurgery it, it is the ſaying of <hi>Avicen;</hi> To be knowne by his being, for it is verily a Medicinall Science. And as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, He that will know the certainty of a thing, let him not buſie himſelfe to know onely the name of that thing, but alſo the working and the effect of the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>Now the third way to know what thing Chirurgerie is, it is alſo to be knowne by his being or declaring of his owne proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the which teacheth vs to worke in mans body with hands, as thus: In cutting and opening thoſe parts that be whole, and in healing thoſe parts that be broken or cut, and in taking away that that is ſuperfluous, as Wartes, Wennes, Skurfulas, and other of like effect.</p>
               <p>But further, to declare what <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith Chirurgery is, it is the laſt Inſtrument of Medicine: that is to ſay, Diet, Potion, and Chirurgery: of the which thrée ſaith he, Diet is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt, and the moſt vertuous: and thus he ſaith. Whereas a man may be cured with Diet onely, let there be given no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Medicine. The ſecond Inſtrument, is Potion: for and if a man may be cured with Diet and Potion, let there not bée miniſtred any Chirurgery, through whoſe vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is removed and put away many grievous infirmities and Diſeaſes, which might not haue béene removed nor yet put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, neither with Diet nor with Potion. And by theſe thrée meanes, it is knowne what thing Chirurgery is. And this ſufficeth vs for that point.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99028:7"/>
               <p>Now it is knowne what thing Chirurgerie is, there muſt alſo be choſen a man apt and méete to miniſter Chirurgery or to be a Chirurgion. And in this point all Authors doe agrée, that a Chirurgion ſhould be choſen by his Complexion, and that his complexion bée very temperate, and all his members well proportioned. For <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith: Whoſe face is not ſéeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is vnpoſſible for him to haue good manners. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the great Philoſopher, writeth in his Epiſtles to the Noble King <hi>Alexander</hi> (as in thoſe Epiſtles more plainly doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare) how he ſhould chooſe all ſuch perſons as ſhould ſerue him, by the forme and ſhape of the face, and all other members of the body. And furthermore they ſay, he that is of an evill Complexion, there muſt néeds follow like Conditions.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it agréeth, that he that will take vpon him to practiſe as a Chirugion, muſt be both of a good and temperate complexion, as is afore rehearſed: and principally, that he be a good liver, and a kéeper of the holy Commandements of God, of whom commeth all cunning and grace, and that his body be not quaking and his bands ſtedfaſt, his fingers long and ſmall, and not trembling: and that his left hand be as ready as his right, with all his limmes, able to fulfill the good workes of the ſoule. Now as here is a man méete to be made a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: (and though he haue all thoſe good qualities before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed) yet is he no good Chirurgion, but a man very fit and méete for the practiſe.</p>
               <p>Now then to know what properties and conditions this man muſt haue before he be a perfect Chirurgion. I doe note foure things moſt ſpecially, that every Chirurgion ought for to haue: The firſt, that he be learned: The ſecond, that he be expert: The third, that he be ingenious: The fourth, that he be well mannered. The firſt (I ſaid) he ought to be learned, and that he know his principles, not onely in Chirurgery, but alſo in Phyſicke, that he may the better defend his Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; alſo hée ought to be ſéene in naturall Philſophy, and in Grammar, that he ſpeake congruity in Logicke, that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99028:8"/>him to prooue his proportions with good reaſon: In Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricke, that teacheth him to ſpeake ſéemely and eloquently: alſo in Theoricke, that teacheth him to know things naturall, and not naturall, and things againſt Nature. Alſo hée muſt know the Anatomie: for all Authors write againſt thoſe Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions that worke in mans body, not knowing the Anatomy: For they be likened to a blind man, that cutteth in a Vine trée, for he taketh more or leſſe then he ought to doe. And here no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e well the ſayings of <hi>Galen,</hi> the Prince of Philoſophers, in his <hi>Eſtoris.</hi> That it is as poſſible for a Chirurgion (not knowing the Anatomy) to worke in mans body without error, as it is for a blind man to carue an Image and make it perfect. The ſecond, I ſaid, he muſt be expert: For <hi>Rafus</hi> ſaith: He ought to know and to ſée other men worke, and after to haue vſe and exerciſe. The third, that he be ingenious and witty: for all things belonging to Chirurgery may not be written, nor with letters ſet forth. The fourth, I ſaid, that he muſt be well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nered, and that he haue all theſe good conditions here following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that he be no Spouſe-breaker, nor no Drunkard. For the Philoſophers ſay, amongſt all other things, beware of thoſe perſons that follow Drunkenneſſe, for they be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for no men, becauſe they liue a life beſtiall: wherefore amongſt all other ſorts of people, they ought to bée ſequeſtred from the miniſtring of Medicine. Likewiſe, a Chirurgion muſt take héed that he deceiue no man with his vaine promiſes, for to make of a ſmall matter a great, becauſe he would be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the more famous. And amongſt other things, they may neyther be flatterers nor mockers, nor priuy backbiters of other men. Likewiſe, they muſt not be proud, nor preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: nor detracters of other men. Likewiſe, they ought not to be covetous, nor nonyggard, and namely amongſt their friends, or men of Worſhip, but let them be honeſt, courteous, and frée both in word and déed. Likewiſe, they ſhall giue no counſell except they be asked, and then ſay their advice by good deliberation, and that they be well adviſed before they ſpeake,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99028:8"/>chiefly in the preſence of wiſe men. Likewiſe, they muſt be as priuy and as ſecret as any Confeſſour, of all things that they ſhall either heare or ſée in the houſe of their Patient. They ſhall not take into their cure any manner of perſon, except hée will be obedient vnto their precepts: for he cannot be called a Patient, vnleſſe he be a ſufferer. Alſo that they doe their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence as well to the poore as to the rich. They ſhall never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort their Patient, and ſhall command all that be about him that they doe the ſame, but to his friends ſpeake truth as the caſe ſtandeth. They muſt alſo be hold in thoſe things whereof they be certaine, and as dreadfull in all perils. They may not chide with the ſicke, but be alwayes pleaſant and merry. They muſt not covet any woman by way of villany, and ſpecially in the houſe of their Patient. They ſhall not for covetouſneſſe of money, take in hand thoſe cures that be vncurable, nor never ſet any certaine day of the ſicke mans health, for it lyeth not in their power: following the diſtinct counſell of <hi>Galen,</hi> in the Aphoriſme of <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> ſaying:
<q>Oporter ſeipſum non ſolum.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this <hi>Galen</hi> meaneth, that to the cure of every ſore, there belongeth foure things: of which, the firſt and principall belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to God: the ſecond, to the Surgion: the third, to the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: and the fourth, to the Patient. Of the which foure, and if any one doe faile, the Patient cannot be healed: then they to whom belongeth but the fourth part, ſhall not promiſe the whole but be firſt well aduiſed. They muſt alſo be gracious and good to the poore, and of the rich take liberally for both. And ſée they never praiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, for that redoundeth more to their ſhame and diſcredit, then to their fame and worſhip. For a cunning and skillfull Chirurgion, néed never vaunt of his doings, for his works will ever get credit enough. Likewiſe, that they deſpiſe no other Chirurgion without a great cauſe: for it is méet, that one Chirurgion ſhould loue another, as Chriſt loveth vs all.</p>
               <p>And in thus doing, they ſhall increaſe both in vertue and cunning, to the honor of God, and worldly ſame.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd if it bee asked you how many ſimple Members there be, it is to be anſwered, Eleven, and two that be but ſuperfluities of Members: and theſe be they, Bones, Cart<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall begin at the Bone, becauſe it is the Foundation and the haideſt Member of all the Body. The Bone is a coſimile Member, ſimple and ſpermaticke, and cold and dry of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, inſenſible, and inflexible: and hath divers formes in Mans body, for the diverſity of helpings. The cauſe why there be many Bones in mans body, is this: Sometime it is néedfull that one members or one limbe ſhould mooue without another: another cauſe is, that ſome defend the principall members, as both the Bone of the Breſt, and of the Head: and ſome to bée the Foundation of divers parts of the Body, as the Bones of the ridge and of the Legges: and ſome to fulfill the hollow places, as in the Hands and Féet, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Griſtle is a member ſimple and Spermaticke, next in hardneſſe to the Bone, and is of complexion cold and dry, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99028:10"/>The Griſtle was ordained for ſixe cauſes or profits that I find in it: The firſt is, that the continuall mooving of the hard Bone might not be done in a juncture, but that the Griſtle ſhould be a meane betwéene the Ligament and him. The ſecond is, that in the time of concuſſion or oppreſſion, the ſoft members or limbes ſhould not be hurt of the hard. The third is, that the extremity of Bones and Ioynts that be griſly, might the eaſier be foulded and n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wved together, without hurt. The fourth is, for that it is neceſſary in ſome meane places, to put a Griſtle, as in the throat bowle for the the ſound. The fifth is, for that it is néedfull that ſome members be holden vp with a Griſtle, as the lids of the Eyes. The ſixt is, that ſome Limbes haus a ſuſtaining and a drawing abroad, as in the Noſe and the Eares, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Ligament is a member conſimple, ſimple, and ſperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, next in hardneſſe to the Griſtle, and of complexion cold and dry, and is flexible and inſenſible, and bindeth the Bones together. The cauſe why he is flexible and inſenſible, is this: If it had béene ſenſible, he might not haue ſuffered the labour and mooving of the Ioynts: and if it had not béene flexible of his bowing, one Limme ſhould not haue mooved without ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ſecond profit is, that he be joyned with ſinewes, for to make Cordes and Bawnes. The third helpe is, that he be a reſting place to ſome ſinewes. The fourth profit is, that by him the members that be within the Bone be ſuſtained, as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trixe and Kidneys, and divers other, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Sinew is a conſimiler member, ſimple and ſpermatick, a meane betwéene hard and ſoft, and in complexion cold and dry and he is both flexible and ſenſible, ſtrong and tough, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his beginning from the Braine, or from <hi>Mynuca,</hi> which is the Marrow of the backe. And from the braine commeth ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven paire of Nerues ſentatine, and from <hi>Mynuca</hi> commeth thirty paire of Nerues motiue, and one that is by himſelfe, that ſpringeth of the laſt ſpondell. All theſe ſinewes haue both fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and mooving, in ſome more, and in ſome leſſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99028:10"/>
               <p>A Corde or Tendon is a conſimple or officiall member com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and ſpermaticke, ſinowy, ſtrong and tough, meanely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene hardneſſe and ſoftneſſe, and meanly ſenſible and flexible and in complexion cold and dry. And the Corde or Tendon is thus made: The ſinewes that come from the braine and from <hi>Mynuca,</hi> and goe to mone the members, is intermingled with the Lygaments, and when the ſinewes and Lygaments are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled together, then is made a Corde. And for thrée cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes I perceiue why the Cordes were made.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that the ſinew alone is ſo ſenſible, that hée may not ſuffer the great labour and travell of moving, without the fellowſhip and ſtrength of the Ligament that is inſenſible, and that letteth his great féeling, and bringeth him to a perfit tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And ſo the Cordes moue the limbes to the will of the ſoule. And this Corde is aſſociated with a simple f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, and ſo thereof is made a Brawne or a Muskle, on whom he might reſt after his travell: and this Brawne is called a Muskle. Then when this Corde is entred into this Brawne, he is departed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many ſmall thréeds, the which be called Will: and this Will hath thrée properties: The firſt is in length, by whoſe vertue that draweth it hath might. The ſecond in breadth by whom the vertue that caſteth out hath might. The third, in thwartnes, in whom the vertue that holdeth hath might: and at the end of the Brawne thoſe thréeds be gathered together to make another Muskle, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now I will begin at the Arteir. This Arteir is a member conſimile, ſimple and ſpermaticke hollow and finowie, having his ſpringing from the heart, bringing from the heart to every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, blood and ſpirit of life. It is of complexion cold and dry. And all theſe Arteirs haue two coates, except one that goeth to the Lungs, and he hath but one coate that ſpreadeth abroad in the Lungs, and bringeth with him to the Lungs blood with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life to nouriſh the Lungs withall: And alſo that Arteir bringeth with him from the Lungs ayre to temper the fumous heate that is in the heart. And this Arteir is he that is called
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99028:11"/>
                  <hi>Arteria Venalis,</hi> becauſe he hath but one coate, as a vaine, and is more obedient to be delated abroad through all the Kings, becauſe that the blood might the ſooner ſweat through him: whereas all other Arteirs haue two coates, becauſe one coate may not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the might and power of the ſpirit of life. Divers other cauſes there be, which ſhall be declared in the Anatomie of the breaſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Veyne is a ſimple member, in complexion cold and dry, and ſpermaticke, like to the Arteir, having his beginning from the Liver and bringeth from the Liuer nutritiue blood, to nouriſh euery member of the body with. And it is ſo to be vnderſtood, that there is no more difference betwéene theſe two veſſels of blood, but that the Arteir is a veſſell of blood ſpirituall or vitall. And the Veyne is a veſſell of blood nutrimentall, of the which Veynes, there is noted two moſt principall, of the which, one is called <hi>Vena Porta:</hi> the other is called <hi>Venacelis,</hi> of whom it is too much to treat of now, vntill we come to the Anatomy of the Wombe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Fleſh, is a conſimile member, ſimple, not ſpermaticke, and is ingendred of blood congealed by heate, and is in complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hot and moyſt. Of the which is noted three kinds of fleſhes; that is to ſay, one is ſoft and pure fleſh: the ſecond is Muſculus, or hard and brawny fleſh: the third is Glandulus, knotty, or kurnelly fleſh. Alſo the commodities of the fleſh, be indifferent, or ſome be common to every kinde of fleſh, and ſome be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to one manner of fleſh alone. The profites of the fleſh be many, for ſome defend the body from cold as death cloathes: alſo it defendeth the body from hard things comming againſt it: ſo through his moyſture he rectifyeth the Body in Summer, in time of great heate.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is to be conſidered, what profitableneſſe is in every kind of fleſh by himſelf. And firſt of ſimple and pure fleſh, which fulfilleth the concavities of voyd places, and cauſeth good forme and ſhape: and this fleſh is found betwéene the téeth, and on the end of the yard. The profit of the Brawny fleſh or Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99028:11"/>fleſh, ſhall be ſpoken of in the Anatomy of the Armes. The profits of the Grandulus fleſh are theſe. Firſt, that it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the blood into a colour like to himſelfe, as doth the fleſh of a womans pappes turne the menſtruall Blood into milke. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Grandulus fleſh of the Teſtikles, turneth the blood into Sparme. Thirdly, the Grandulus fleſh of the chéekes, that engendreth the ſpettle, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The next is of Fatneſſe, of the which I finde thrée kindes. The firſt is <hi>Pinguedo,</hi> and it is a conſimiler member, not ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke, and it is made of a ſubtill portion of Blood congealed by colde: and it is of complexion cold and moyſt, inſenſible, and is intermingled amongſt the parts of the fleſh. The ſecond, is <hi>Adepper,</hi> and is of the ſame kind as is <hi>Pinguedo,</hi> but it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the fleſh beſides the Skinne, and it is an Oyle hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and moyſting the Skinne. The third is <hi>Auxingia,</hi> and it is of kinde as the others be, but he is departed from the fleſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in foorth about the Kidneyes, and in the Intrailes, and it helpeth both the Kidneyes and the Intrailes, from drying by his <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>tio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then come wée to the Skinne. The Skinne is a conſimile member of officiall, partly ſpermaticke, ſtrong and tough, flexible and ſenſible, thinne and temperate: whereof there be two kinds: One is the Skin that covereth the outward members: and the other the inner members, which is called a Pannicle, the profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableſſ of whom, was ſpoken in the laſt leſſon: but the Skinne is properly wovent of L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>réeds, Nerues, Veynes, and Arteirs. And he is made temperate, becauſe he ſhould be a good déemer of heate from cold, and of moyſtneſſe from dryneſſe, that there ſhould nothing annoy or hurt the Body, but it giveth warning to the common wits thereof, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The haires of every part of mans Body, are but ſuperfluity of members, made of the groſſe ſume or ſmoake paſſing out of the viſcous matter, thickned to the forme of haire. The profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of him is declared in the Anatomy of the heard, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Nayles likewiſe, are a ſuperfluity of members, engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99028:12"/>of great earthly ſmoake or fume reſolved through the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heate of humors, and is ſofter then the bone, and harder then the fleſh. In complexion they be cold and dry, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes waxing in the extremity of the fingers and toes. The vtility of them are, that by them a man ſhall take the better hold: alſo they helpe to claw the body when it néedeth. Laſtly, they helpe to divide things for lacke of other fooles, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. The Anatomie of the compound Members, and firſt of the Head.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe the Head of man is the habitation or dwelling place of the reaſonable ſoule of man, therefore with the grace of God, I ſhall firſt ſpeake of the Anatomie of the bead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith in the ſecond Chapter <hi>De juva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,</hi> and <hi>Avicen</hi> rehearſeth the ſame in his firſt Propoſition and third Chapter, proving that the head of man was made nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for wits, nor yet for the Braines, but onely for the Eyes. For beaſts that haue no heads, haue the organs or inſtruments of wits in there breaſts. Therefore GOD and Nature haue reared vp the head of man onely for the eyes, for it is the higheſt member of man: and as a Beholder or Watchman ſtandeth in a high Tower to giue warning of the Enemies, ſo doth the Eye of man giue warning vnto the common Wittes, for the defence of all other members of the body.</p>
               <p>Now to our purpoſe. If the queſtion be asked, how many things be there contained on the Head, and how many things contained within the head? As it is rehearſed by <hi>Guydo,</hi> there be fiue containing, and as many contained, as thus: The haire, the skin, the fleſh, the Pannicles, and the Bone; neither rehearſing Veine nor Arteir. The which Anatomy cannot be truly without them both, as thou ſhalt well perceiue both in this but eſpecially in the next. And how in this Leſſon I ſhall ſpeake but of Haire,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99028:12"/>Skin, Fleſh, Veynes, Pannicles, and Bones, what profit they doe to man, every of them in his kind. Of the haire of the Head, (whoſe creation is knowne in the Anatomy of the ſimple mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) I doe note foure vtilities why it was ordained. The firſt is, that it defendeth the braine from too much heat, and too much cold, and many other outward noyances.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, it maketh the forme or ſhape of the Head to ſéeme more ſéemelyer or beautifuller. For if the Head were not haired, the Face and the Head ſhould ſéeme but one thing, and therefore the haire formeth &amp; ſhapeth the Head from the Face.</p>
               <p>The third is, that by colour of the haire, is witneſſed and knowne the complexion of the Braine.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, that the fumoſities of the Braine might aſcend and paſſe lightlyer out by them. For, if there were a ſad thing, as the skinne, or other of the ſame nature, as the Haire is, the fumoſities of the Braine might not haue paſſed through it ſo lightly, as it doth by the Haire.</p>
               <p>The Skin of the head is more Lazartus, thicker, and more Porrus, then any other Skinne of any other member of the body. And two cauſes I note why; One is, that it kéepeth or defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Braine from too much heat and cold as doth the Haire. The other, that it diſcuſſeth to the common wits of all things that noyeth outwardly, for the haire is inſenſible. The third cauſe why the skinne of the head is more thicker then any other ſkinne of the body is this; that it kéepeth the braine the more warme, and is the better fence for the Braine, and it bindeth and kéepeth the Bones of the head the faſter together.</p>
               <p>Next followeth the Fleſh, the which is all Muſculus or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zartus fleſh, lying vpon Pericrantum without meane. And it is made of ſubtill Will, and of ſimple fleſh, Sinewes, Veynes and Arteirs. And why the fleſh that is all Muſculus or Lazartus in every member of a mans body was made, is for three cauſes. The firſt is, that by his thickneſſe, he ſhould comfort the digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other members that lye by him The ſecond is, that through him every member is made the formelier, and taketh the better
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99028:13"/>ſhape. The third is, that by his meanes every member of the Body, drawing to him nouriſhing, the which others with-hold to put foorth from them, as it ſhall be more plainlyer ſpoken of in the Anatomy of the Wombe.</p>
               <p>Next followeth Pericranium, or the covering of the Bones of the Head. But here it is to be noted of a Veyne and an Arteir that commeth betwéene the Fleſh and this Pericraniam, that nouriſheth the vtter part of the head, and ſo entreth pri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ily tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Commiſſaries of the Skull, bearing to the Braine and to his Pannicles nouriſhing: Of whoſe ſubſtance, is made both Duramater, and alſo Pericranium, as ſhall be declared in the parts contayned in the Head. Here it is to be noted of this Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle Pericranium, that it bindeth or compaſſeth all the Bones of the Head, vnto whom is adjoyned Duramater, and is alſo a part of his ſubſtance, he wheit they be ſeparated, for Durama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is néerer the Braine, and is vnder the Skull.</p>
               <p>This Pericranium was made principally for two cauſes: one is, that for <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is ſtrong binding together, hée ſhould make firme and ſtable the féeble Commiſſaries or ſeames of the Bones of the Head. The other cauſe is, that it ſhould be a meane betwéene the hard bone and the ſoft fleſh.</p>
               <p>Next, is the Bone of the Pot of the head, kéeping in the Braines, of which it were too long to declaire their names after all Authors, as they number them and their names, for ſome name them after the Gréeke tongue, and ſome after the Arabian: but in concluſion all this to our purpoſe. And they be numbred ſeven bones in the pan or Skull of the head. The firſt is called the Coronall bone, in which is the Orbits or holes of the Eyes, and it reacheth from the browes vnto the midſt of the head, and there it méeteth with the ſecond bone called Occipiſſiall, a bone of the hinder part of the head called the Noddle, of the head, which two bones Coronall and Occipiſſiall, be divided by the Commiſſaries, in the middeſt of the Head. The third and fourth Bones bée called Parietales, and they be the Bones of the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling parts of the head, and they be divided by the Commiſſaries,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99028:13"/>both from the foreſaid Coronall and Occipiſſiall. The fi<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>-and Art bones be called, Petroſa or Mendoſa: and theſe two bones lye over the bones called, Parietales, on every ſide of the head one, like Skales, in whom be the holes of the cares. The ſeventh and laſt of the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>riment, but alſo doe weaue themſelves ſo together, that they make this Pannicle Duramater. It is holden vp by certaine thréeds of himſelfe, comming through the ſaid Commiſſaries, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into Pericranium or Pannicle that covereth the Bones of the Head. And with the foreſaid Veine and Artier, and theſe threeds, comming from Duramater, is woven and made this Pericranium.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:99028:14"/>
               <p>And why this Pannicle Duramater is ſet from the Skull, I note two cauſes. The firſt is, that if the Duramater ſhould haue touched the Skull, it ſhould lightly haue béene hurt with the hardneſſe of the Bone. The ſecond cauſe is, that the matter that commeth of wounds made in the Head piercing the Skull, ſhould by it the better be defended and kept from Piamater, and hurting of the Braine. And next vnto this Pannicle, there is another Pannicle called Piamater, or Méek-mother, becauſe it is ſoft and tender vnto the Braine. Of whoſe creation, it is to be noted as of Duramater: For the originall of their firſt creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of one kind, both from the Heart and the Liver, and is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the very ſubſtance of the Braine. Why it is called <hi>Piama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> is for becauſe it is ſoft and tender to the Braine, that if nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth the Braine and féedeth it, as doth a loving Mother, vnto her tender Chi<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> or Babe, for it is not ſo tough and hard as is Duramater.</p>
               <p>In this Pannicle Piamater is much to be noted of the great number of Veines and Arteirs that are planted, ramefying throughout all his ſubſtance, giving to the Braine both ſpirit and life. And this Pannicle doth circumvolue or lay all the ſubſtance of the Braine: and in ſome place of the Braine, the Veynes and the Artiers goe forth of him, and enter into the diviſions of the Braine, and there drinketh of the Braines ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance into them, asking of the Heart, to them the ſpirit of life or breath, and of the Liver nu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>riment. And the aforeſaid ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or breath taketh a further diſgeſtion, and there it is made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimall by the elaboration of the ſpirit vitall, is turned and made animall. Furthermore, why there be no more Pannicles over the Braine then one, is this: If there had beene but one Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle onely, either it muſt haue béene hard or ſoft, or meane, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéens both: If it had béene hard, it ſhould haue hurt the Braine by his hardneſſe. If it had béene ſoft, it ſhould haue béene hurt of the hard Bone. And if it had qéene but meanly, neyther hard nor ſoft, it ſhould haue hurt the Braine by his roughneſſe, and alſo haue béene hurt of the hard Bone. Therefore God and Nature
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99028:14"/>hath ordained two Pannicles, the one hard, and the other ſoft, the harder to be a meane betwéene the ſoft and the Bone: and the ſofter to be a meane betwéene the harder and the Braine it ſelfe. Alſo theſe Pannicles be cold and dry of complexion, and ſpermaticke.</p>
               <p>Next is the Braine, of which it is marvellouſly to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and noted, how this Piamater divideth the ſubſtance of the Braine, and lappeth it into certaine ſelles or diviſions, as thus: The ſubſtance of the Braine is divided into thrée parts or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles, of which the foremoſt part is the moſt. The ſecond or middlemoſt is leſſe: the third or hindermoſt is the leaſt. And from each one to another be iſſues or paſſages that are called <hi>Meaces,</hi> through whom paſſeth the ſpirit of life too and fro. But héere yée ſhall note, that euery Tentricle is divided into two parts, and in every part God hath ordained and ſet ſingular and ſeverall vertues, as thus; Firſt, in the foremoſt Ventricle, God hath founded and ſet the common wittes, otherwiſe, called the fine Wittes, as Hearing, Séeing, Féeling, Smelling, and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. And alſo there is one part of this Ventricle, the vertue that is called Fantaſie, and he taketh all the formes or ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that be diſpoſed of the <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ue Wittes, after the meaning of ſenſible things. In the other part of the ſame Ventricle, is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and founded the imaginatiue vertue, the which receiveth of the common Wittes the forme of ſhape of ſenſitiue things as they were received of the common Wittes without-foorth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting their owne ſhape and ordinances vnto the memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue vertue. In the middle Sell or Ventricle, there is founded and ordained the Cogitatiue or eſtimatiue vertue: for hée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſeth, ſheweth, declareth, and déemeth thoſe things that bée offered vnto him, by the other that were ſpoken of before. In the third Ventrickle and laſt, there is founded and ordained the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue Memoratiue: in this place is regiſtred and kept thoſe things that are done and ſpoken with the ſences and kéepe them in his treaſury vnto the putting foorth of the fiue or common Wittes, or Organes, or Inſtruments of animall workes, out of whoſe

               <p>Furthermore it is to be noted, that from the foremoſt Ventricle of the Braine, ſpringeth ſeven paire of ſentatiue or féeling Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, the which be produced to the Eyes, the Eares, the Noſe, the Tongue, and to the Stomacke, and to divers other parts of the Body: as it ſhall be declared in their Anatomies. Alſo it is to be noted, that about the middle Ventrikle is the place of Vermi-formis, with kurnelly fleſh that filleth, and Retemira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile, a wonderfull Cau<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Furthermore yée ſhall vnderſtand, that the Braine is a member cold and moyſt of complexion, thinne, and meanly viſcous, and a principall member, and an officiall member and ſpermaticke. And firſt, why he is a principall member, is becauſe he is the governour or the treaſury of the fiue Wittes: And why he is an officiall member, is, becauſe he hath the effect of féeling and ſtirring: And why he is cold and moyſt, is, that he ſhould by his coldneſſe and moyſtneſſe, abate and temper the excéeding heate and drought that commeth from the Heart. And why it is moyſt, is, that it ſhould be the more indifferenter and abler to every thing that ſhould be reſerved or gotten into him. And why it is ſoft, is, that it ſhould giue place and favour to the vertue of ſtirring. And why it is meanly viſcous, is, that his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99028:15"/>ſinewes ſhould not be letted in their working, through his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much hardneſſe.</p>
               <p>Héere <hi>Galen</hi> demandeth a queſtion, which is this: Whether that féeling and mouing be brought to Nerues by one or by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers? Or whether the aforeſaid thing be brought ſubſtantially or rather judicially? The matter (ſaith hée) is ſo hard to ſearch and to be vnderſtood, that it were much better to let it alone and paſſe over it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> intreating of the Braine, ſaith: The Braine is a member continually moouing and ruling all other members of the body, giving vnto them both féeling and moouing: for if the Braine be let, all other members bée let: and if the Braine bée well, then all other members of the body be the better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Braine hath this property, that it mooveth and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the moouing of the Moone: For in the waxing of the Moone, the Braine followeth vpwards, and in the wane of the Moone, the Braine diſcendeth downewards, and vaniſheth in ſubſtance of vertue: for then the Braine ſhrinketh together in it ſelfe, and is not ſo fully obedient to the ſpirit of féeling. And this is proued in men that be Lunaticke and Mad, and alſo in men that be Epulenticke or having the Falling ſickneſſe, that be moſt grieved in the beginning of the new Moone and in the latter quarter of the Moone. Wherefore (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) when it happeneth that the Braine is either too dry or too moyſt, then can it not worke his kind, for then is the Body made cold<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. V. The Anatomy of the Face.</head>
               <p>THE Front or the Forehead, containeth nothing but the Skinne and Muſculus fleſh, for the Pannicle vnderneath, it is of Pericranium, and the Bone is of the Coronall bone. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there it is made broad as if there were a double bone, which maketh the forme of the browes. It is called the Forehead or Front, from one eare to the other, and from the rootes of the eares of the head before vnto the Browes. But the cauſe why the browes were ſet and reared vp was, that they ſhould defend the eyes from uoyance without-foorth: and they be ordained with haire, to put by the humor or ſweat that commeth from the head. Alſo the browes doe helpe the eye-liddes, and doe beautiffe and make faire the face, for he that hath not his browes haired, is not ſéemely.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, that ouer-meaſurable Browes betokeneth an enuious man. Alſo high browes and thicke, betokcneth hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and browes with little haire betokeneth cowardiſe: and meanly, ſignifieth gentleneſſe of heart. Inciſions about this part, ought to be done according to the length of the body, for there the Muſcle goeth from one eare to the other. And there if any inciſion ſhould be made with the length of the Muſcle, it might happen the brow to hang ouer the eye without remedy, as it is many times ſéene, the more pitty. The Browes are called <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium</hi> in Latine, and vnder is the eye-lids, which is called <hi>Cilium,</hi> and is garniſhed with haires. Two cauſes I find why the eye-lids were ordained. The firſt is, that they ſhould kéepe and defend the Eye from Duſt and other outward uoyances. The ſecond is, when the eye is wrary or heauy, then they ſhould bée covered and take reſt vnderneath them. Why the haires were ordained in them is, that by them is addreſſed the formes or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes of viſible things vnto the Apple of the Eye. The Eare is a member ſeemely and griftly, able to be ſolden without, and is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99028:16"/>the Organ or Inſtrument of Hearing: It is of complexion cold and dry. But why the Eare was ſet vp out of the head, is this, that the ſounds that be very fugitiue, ſhould hirke and abide vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſhadow, till it were taken of the Inſtruments of Hearing. Another cauſe is, that if ſhould kéepe the hole that it ſtandeth over, from things falling in that might hinder the Hearing. The Sinewes that are the Organes or Inſtruments of Hearing, ſpring each from the Braine, from whence the ſeuen paire of Sinewes doe ſpring, and when they come to the hole of the Eare, there they w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. The Eyes be next of nature vnto the ſoule: for in the Eye is ſéene and knowne the diſturbances and griefes, gladneſſe and joyes of the Soule, as Loue, Wrath, and other paſſions. The Eyes be the Inſtruments of ſight. And they be compound and made of ten things: that is ſo ſay, of ſeuen Tunicles or Coates, and of thrée humours. Of the which (ſayth <hi>Galen</hi>) the Braine and the Head were made for the Eye, that they might be in the higheſt as a Beholder in a Tower, as it was revearſed in the Anatomy of the Head. But divers men hold divers opinions of the Anatomy of the Eyes: for ſome men account but thrée Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, and ſome ſixe. But in concluſion, they meane all one thing. For the very truth is, that there be counted and reckoned ſeven Tunicles, that is to ſay, <hi>Sclirotica, Secondina, Retyna, Unia, Cornua, Arania,</hi> and <hi>Conjunctiva:</hi> and theſe thrée humoure. That is to ſay, Humor, <hi>Virtus,</hi> Humor <hi>Albigynus,</hi> and Humor <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be knowne how and after what manner they ſpring: You ſhall vnderſtand, that there ſpringeth of the Braine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his foremoſt Ventrikles, two Sinewes, the one from the right ſide, and the other from the left, and they be called the firſt paire, for in the Anatomy, they be the firſt paire of ſinewes that appeare of all ſeven. And it is ſhewed by <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ales,</hi> that theſe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſes. The firſt is,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99028:17"/>that the viſible ſpirit might paſſe fréely to the Eyes. The ſecond is, that the forme of viſible things might freely be preſented to the common wittes.</p>
               <p>Now marke the going forth of theſe ſinewes. When theſe ſinewes goe out from the ſubſtance of the Braine, he commeth through the Piamater, of whoſe ſubſtance he taketh a Pannicle or a Coate: and the cauſe why he taketh that Pannicle, is to kéepe him from noying, and before they enter into the Skull, they méete and are vnited into one ſinew the length of halfe an inch: and then they depart againe into two, and each goeth into one Eye, entring through the braine Panne, and theſe ſinewes be called <hi>Nervi optici.</hi> And thrée cauſes I finde why theſe Nerues are joyned in one before they paſſe into the Eye. Firſt, if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen any diſeaſes in one Eye, the other ſhould receiue all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſpirit that before come to both.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that all things that wée ſée ſhould not ſéeme two: for if they had not béene joyned together, every thing ſhould have ſéemed two, as it doth to a Worme, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beaſts.</p>
               <p>The <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is, that the ſinew might ſtay and helpe the other. But hereupon <hi>Lanfranke</hi> accordeth much: ſaying, that theſe two ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes came together to the Eyes, and take a Pannicle both of Piamater and of Duramater, and when they enter into the Orbit of the Eye; there the extremities are ſpread abroad, the which are made of thrée ſubſtances: that is to ſay, of Duramater, of Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mater, and of <hi>Nervi optici.</hi> There be engendred thrée Tunicles or Coates, as thus: Of the ſubſtance that is taken from Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mater, is engendred the firſt Coate that is called <hi>Secondina:</hi> and of <hi>Nervi optici,</hi> is engendred the third Coate, that is called <hi>Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi> and each of them is more ſubtilier then other, and goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the humours without meane. And it is to be vnderſtood, that each of theſe three Tunicles be divided, and ſo they make fire: that is to ſay, thrée of the parts of the braine, and thrée of the parts outwards, and one of Pericranium, that covereth the Bones of the head, which is called <hi>Conjunctiva.</hi>

And he goeth about the Chryſtaline Humor, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> méete with Albuginus Humour, which is ſet in the vttermoſt part of the Eye. And in the middeſt of theſe Humours Vltrus, and Albuginus, is ſet the Chryſtaline Humour, in which is ſet principally the ſight of the Eye. And theſe Humours be ſeparated and involued with the Pannicles as aforeſaid, betwéene every Humour a Pannicle. And thus is the Eye compound and made. But to ſpeake of every Humour and every Pannicle in his one order and courſe, it would aske a long proceſſe, and a long Chapter: and this is ſufficient for a Chirurgion. Now to begin at the Noſe: You ſhall vnderſtand, that from the braine there commeth two Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes to the holes of the braine pan, where beginneth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavity of the Noſe, and theſe two be not properly Sinewes, but Organes or Inſtruments of ſmelling, and haue heads like teates or paps, in which is received the vertue of ſmelling, and repreſenting it to the common wits: Ouer theſe two, is ſet Colatorium, that wée call the Noſthrils: and is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the Eyes, vnder the vpper part of the Noſe. And it is to be noted, that this concavity or ditch was made for two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The firſt is, that the ayre that bringeth foorth the ſpirit of ſmelling might reſt in it, till it were taken of the Organe or Inſtrument of ſmelling. The ſecond cauſe is, that the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities of the Braine might be hidden vnder it, vntill it were clenſed: And from this concavity there goeth <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> holes downe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99028:18"/>into the mouth, of which there is to be noted thrée profits.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that when a mans mouth is cloſe, or when he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth or ſléepeth, that then the ayre might come through them to the Lunges, or elſe a mans mouth ſhould alwayes be open. The ſecond cauſe is, that they helpe to the relation of the forme of the Noſe: for it is ſaid, a man ſpeaketh in his Noſe, when any of theſe holes he ſtopped. The third cauſe is, that the concavity might be clenſed by them, when a man ſnuffeth the Noſe, or draweth into his mouth inwardly. The Noſe is a member con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimple or officiall appearing without the face, ſome what <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>licable, becauſe it ſhould the better be cleanſed. And it is to be perceived that it is compound and made of Skin and Lazartus fleſh, and of two Bones ſtanding in manner triangle-wiſe, whoſe extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he joyned in one part of the Noſe with the Coronall Bone, and the nether extremities are joyned with two Griſtles, and another that divideth the Noſthrils within, and holdeth vp the Noſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo there be two concavities or holes, that if one were ſtopped the other ſhould ſerue: Alſo there is in the Noſe two Muſcles to helpe the working of his Office.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth, that the Noſe ſhapeth the Face moſt: for where the Noſe lacketh (ſayth he) all the reſt of the Face is the more vnſéemely. The Noſe ſhould be of a meane bigneſſe, and not to excéed in length or bredth, nor in highneſſe. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, If the Noſthrils be too thin or too wide, by great drawing in of ayre, it betokeneth great ſtraitneſſe of heart and indignation of thought. And therefore it is to be noted, that the ſhape of the members of the Body, betokeneth and judgeth the affections and will of the ſoule of man, as the Philoſopher ſaith. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples he called the members of the Head, and they haue that name becauſe of continuall mouing. And as the Science of the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my meaneth, the ſpirit vitall is ſent from the heart to the braine by Arteirs, and by Veines and nutrimentall blood, where the Veſſels Pulſati<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es in the Temples be lightly hurt. Alſo, the Temple haue <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ents or holes inwardly, wherein hée taketh the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99028:18"/>humour that commeth from the Braine, and bringeth the Eyes aſléepe: and if the ſaid Holes or Dents be preſſed and wrung, then by trapping of the humour that continueth, hée maketh the teares to fall from the Eye.</p>
               <p>The Chéekes are the ſideling parts of the Face, and they containe in them Muſculus fleſh, with Veynes and Arteirs, and about theſe parts be many Muſcles. <hi>Guido</hi> maketh mention of ſeven about the Chéekes and ouer-lip.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Haly Abbas</hi> ſaith, there be twelue Muſcles that mooue the nether Iaw, ſome of them in opening, and otherſome in cloſing or ſhutting, paſſing vnder the Bones of the Temples: and they be called <hi>Temporales:</hi> And they be the right noble and ſenſatiue, of whoſe hurt is much perill.</p>
               <p>Alſo there bée other Muſculus for to grinde and to chew. And to all theſe Muſcles commeth Nerues from the Braine, to giue them féeling and mouing. And alſo there commeth to them, many Arteirs and Veynes, and chiefly about the Temples, and the angles or corners of the Eyes and the Lips. And as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſay, the chiefe beauty in man is in the Chéekes, and there the complexion of man is moſt knowne, as thus: If they bée full, ruddy, and medled with temperate whiteneſſe, and not fat in ſubſtance, but meanely fleſhie, it betokeneth hot and moyſt of complexion: that is, Sanguine and temperate in colour. And if they be white coloured, without medling of redneſſe, and in ſubſtance fat and ſoft, quavering, it betokeneth, exceſſe and ſuperfluity of cold and moyſt: that is flegmaticke. And if they be browne in colour or cyfren, yeallow, redde and thinne, and leaue inſubſtance, it betokeneth great drying and heate: that is chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke. And if they be as it were blowne in colour, and of little fleſh in ſubſtance, it Betokeneth exceſſe and ſuperfluity of dryneſſe and cold: that is Melancholy And as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, the Chéekes doe not onely ſhew the diverſities of complexions, but alſo the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and will of the Heart: for by the affection of the heart, by ſuddaine joy or dread, he waxeth either pale or red. The bones or bony parts, firſt of the chéekes be two: of the Noſe outwardly,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99028:19"/>two: of the vpper Mandible, two: within the Noſe thrée, as thus: One deviding the Noſthrils within, and in each Noſthrill one, and they ſéeme to be rowled like a water, and haue a hollowneſſe in them, by which the ayre is reſpired and drawne to the Lungs, and the ſuperfluity of the Braine is purged into the mouth<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wards, as in before rehearſed. But <hi>Guido</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that there be in the face nine bones, yet I cannot find that the nether Mandible ſhould be of the number of thoſe nine: for the nether Mandible accounted there, proueth them to be ten in number: Of which thing I will hold no argument, but remit it to the ſight of your Eyes. The parts of the mouth are fiue, that is to ſay, the Lippes, the Téeth, the Tongue, the Vuila, and the Pallet of the mouth. And firſt to ſpeake of the Lips, they are members conſimile or officiall, full of Muſculus fleſh, as is aforeſaid, and they were ordained for two cauſes, one is; that they ſhould be to the mouth as a doore to a houſe, and to kéepe the mouth cloſe till the meat were kindly chewed. The other cauſe is, that they ſhould be helpers to the pronouncing of the ſpéech. The Téeth are members conſimily or officiall, ſpermaticke, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of any other members, and are faſtned in the Chéeke bones, and were ordained for thrée cauſes. Firſt, that they ſhould chew a mans meate, ere it ſhould paſſe downe, that it might bée the ſooner digeſted.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, that they ſhould be a helpe to the ſpéech: for they that lacke their téeth, doe not perfectly pronounce their words.</p>
               <p>The third is, that they ſhould ſerue to beaſts as weapons. The number of them is vncertaine: for ſome men haue moe, and ſome leſſe: they that haue the whole number, haue two and thirty: that is to ſay ſixtéene aboue, and as many beneath as thus: two Dwallies, two Quadripulles, two Canniens, eight Morales, and two Cauſales, the Tongue is a carnous member, compound and made of many Nerues, Ligaments, Veynes and Artiers, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned principally for thrée cauſes.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that when a man cateth, the Tongue might helpe to turne the meat till it were well chewed. The ſecond
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99028:19"/>cauſe is, that by him is received the taſt of ſwéete and ſowre, and preſented by him to the common Wittes. The third is, that by him is pronounced euery ſpéech The fleſhie part of the Tongue is white, and hath in him nine Muſcles, and about the roote of him, is Glandulus, in the which be two welles, and they be ever full of ſpettle to temper and kéepe moyſt the Tongue, or elſe it would ware dry by reaſon of his labour, &amp;c. The Vuila is a member made of ſpongeous fleſh, banging downe from the end of the Pallet ouer the gullet of the throat, and is a member in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion cold and dry, and oftentimes when there falleth raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or much moyſtneſſe into it from the Head, then it hangeth downe in the throate, and letteth a man to ſwallow, and it is broad at the vpper end, and ſmall at the nether. It was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for divers cauſes. One is, that by him is holpen the ſound of ſpéech: for where the Vuila is wanting, there lacketh the perfect ſound of ſpeech. Another is, that it might helpe the prolation of vomits. Another is, that by him is tempered and abated the diſtemperance of the ayre that paſſeth to the Lungs. Another is, that by him is guided the ſuperfluities of the Braine, that commeth from the coletures of the Noſe, or the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities ſhould fall downe ſuddenly into the mouth, the which were a diſpleaſure. The Pallet of the mouth containeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a carnous Pannicle, and the Bones that bée vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath it hath two diviſions, one along the Pallet from the diviſion of the Noſe, and from the opening of the other Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible vnder the nether end of the Pallet, lacking halfe an inch, and there it divideth overthwart, and the firſt diviſion is of the Mandible: and the ſecond, is of the Bone called Pi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>illary or Bazillary, that ſuſtaineth and bindeth all other Bones of the head together. The Skinne of the Pallet of the mouth is, of the inner part of the ſtomacke and of Myre, and of Iſofagus, that is the way of the meate into the Stomacke. The way how to know that ſuch a Pannicle is of that part of the ſtomack, may be knowne when that a man is touched within the mouth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonhe beginneth to tickle in the ſtomacke, and the néerer that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99028:20"/>he ſhall couch vnto the throat, the more it abhorreth the ſtomacke, and oftentimes it cauſeth the ſtomacke to yéeld from him that is within him, and when a man doth vomit.</p>
               <p>Alſo in the mouth is ended the vppermoſt extremity of the Weſand, which is called Myre, or Iſofagus: And with him is contayned <hi>Trachia arteria:</hi> that is, the way of the ayre, whoſe holes be covered with a lap like a tongue, and is griſtly, that the meat and drinke might ſlide ouer him into Iſofagus: the which griſtle when a man ſpeaketh is reared vp, and covereth the way of the meate, and when a man ſwalloweth the meate, then it covereth the way of the ayre, ſo that when the one is covered, the other is diſcovered. For if a man open the way of the ayre, when he ſwalloweth, if there fall a crum inco it, hée ſhall never ceaſe coughing vntill it be vp againe. And this ſufficeth for the Face.</p>

               <p>THE Necke followeth next to be ſpoken of. <hi>Galen</hi> proveth, that the Necke was made for no other cauſe but for the Lungs, for all things that haue no Lungs, haue neyther Necke nor voyce, except Fiſh. And you ſhall vnderſtand, that the necke is all that is contayned betwéene the head and the ſhoulders, and betwéene the chin and the breaſt. It is compound and made of foure things, that is to ſay, of <hi>Spondillis,</hi> of <hi>Servic<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Spondels of the Necke be ſeven: The firſt is joyned vnto the lower part of the head called Paxillary, or Bazillary, and in the ſame wiſe are joyned euery Spondell with other, and the laſt of the ſeuen, with the firſt of the Backe or Ridge: and the Lygaments that kéepe theſe Spondels together, are not ſo hard
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99028:20"/>and tough as thoſe of the backe: for why? thoſe of the necke bée more féebler and ſubtiller. The cauſe is this, for it is neceſſary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while that the head moue without the necke, and the Necke without the Head, the which might not well haue béene done if they had béene ſtrong and boyſtrous. Of theſe aforeſaid ſeuen Spondels of the Necke, there ſpringeth ſeuen paire of Sinewes, the which be divided into the head and into the viſage, to the Shoulders and to the Armes. From the hole of the firſt Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell ſpringeth the firſt paire of Sinewes, betwéeen the firſt Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell and the ſecond, and ſo forth of all the reſt in like manner as of theſe. Alſo theſe Sinewes receiue ſubtill will of the ſinewes of the braine: of which the Will, and Sinewes, and Fleſh, with a Pannicle, make the compoſition of Muſcles, Lazartes, and Brawnes, the which thrée things are all one, and be the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of voluntary mouing euery member. The Muſcles of the Necke after <hi>Galen,</hi> are numbred to be twenty, mouing the Head and the Necke. Likewiſe it is to be noted, that there bée thrée manner of fleſhes in the Necke: the firſt is <hi>Pixwex,</hi> or Seruiſis, and it is called of Children, Gold haire, or yeallow haire, the which are certaine Longitudinals, lying on the ſides of the Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, from the head downe to the latter Spondell. And they are ordained for this cauſe, that when the Sinewes be weary of ouer much labour with mouing and travell, that they might reſt vpon them as vpon a Bed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Fleſh is Muſculus, from whom ſpringeth the Tendons and Cords that moue the Head and the Necke, which be numbred twenty, as is before declared. The third Fleſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſheth the void places, &amp;c. The third part of the Necke, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gutture,</hi> and it is ſtanding out of the throat boll. The fourth part is called <hi>Gula,</hi> and the hinder part <hi>Cervix,</hi> and hath that name of the Philoſophers, becauſe of the Marrow comming to the Ridge bones. It is ſo called, becauſe it is as it were a ſervant to the Braine: For the Necke receiveth and taksth of the braine, influence of vertue of mouing, and ſendeth it by ſinewes to the other parts of the body downewards, and to all members of the body.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:99028:21"/>
               <p>Héere you ſhall vnderſtand, that the way of the meate, and Mire, or Iſofagus, is all one thing: and it is to be noted, that it ſtretcheth from the mouth to the Stomacke, by the hinder part of the Necke inwardly, faſtned to the Spondels of the Necke, vntill hée come to the firſt Spondell, and there hée leaveth the Spondell, and ſtretcheth till hée come to the foremoſt part of the Breaſt, and paſſeth through <hi>Diafragma,</hi> till hée come to the mouth of the ſtomacke, and there hée is ended. Furthermore, it is to bée noted that this Weaſand is compound, and made of two Tunicles or Coates (that is to ſay) or the inner and of the vtter. The vtter Tunicle is but ſimple, for hée néedeth no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention but onely for his owne nouriſhing: but the inner Tunicle is compound, and made of Muſculus Longitudinall Will, by which he may draw the meate from the mouth into the ſtomack, as it ſhall hée more plainly declared in the Anatomy of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke. Furthermore, <hi>Cana Pulmonis, via, trachia, Arteria,</hi> all theſe be one thing (that is to ſay) the Throt-boll, and it is ſet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Necke, beſides the Weſand, towards <hi>Gula,</hi> and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of the Griſtle, knit each with other. And the Pannicle that is meane betwéene the Weſand, and the Throt boll, is called <hi>Iſmon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo yée ſhall vnderſtand that the great Veynes which ramefic by the ſides of the Necke, to the vpper part of the head, is of ſome men called <hi>Gwidege,</hi> and of others, <hi>Venae organices:</hi> the inciſion of whom is perillous. And thus it is to be conſidered, that the neck of man is compound, and made of skinny Fleſh, Ligaments, and bones: and this ſufficeth for the Necke and the Throate.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. The Anatomy of the Shoulders and Armes.</head>
               <p>AND firſt to ſpeake of the Bones: It is to bée noted, that in the Shoulder there bée two Bones, (that is to ſay) the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99028:21"/>Shoulder bone, and the Kannell-bone, and alſo the <hi>Adiutor</hi> bone of the Anne, are joyned with the Shoulder-bones, but they are not numbred amongſt them, but amongſt the Bones of the Armes. In the compoſition of the ſhoulder, the firſt Bone is, <hi>Os Spatula,</hi> or Shoulder blade, whoſe hinder part is declined towards the Chine, and in that end it is broad and thinne, and in the vpper part it is round, in whoſe roundneſſe is a Concavity, which is called the Boxe or coope of the ſhoulder, and which entreth the <hi>Adiutor</hi> bones, and they haue a binding together with ſtrong flexible Sinewes, and are contained faſt with each Bone called <hi>Clauicula,</hi> or the Cannell bone. And this Cannell bone ſtretcheth to both the ſhoulders; One end to the one ſhoulder, and another to the other, and there they make the compoſition of the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The bones of the great arme, (that is to ſay) from the ſhoulders to the fingers ends, be thirty: the firſt is, the <hi>Adiutor</hi> bone, whoſe vpper end entreth into the Concavity or Boxe of the Shoulder bone: it is but one Bone (having no fellow) end it is hollow and full of Marrow, and it is alſo crooked, becauſe it ſhould be the more able to gripe things, and it is hollow, becauſe it ſhould be lighter and more obedient to the ſtirring or mouing of the Brawnes.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, this Bone hath two eminences, or two knobs in his nether extremity, or in the juncture of the Elbow (of the which, the one is more Riſing then the other) and are made like vnto a Pully to draw water with, and the ends of theſe Bones enter into a Concavity proportioned in the vppermoſt ends of the two Fo<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lbones, of which two Bones, the leſſe goeth from the Elbow to the Thumb<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, by the vppermoſt part of the arme, and the greater is the nether bone from the Elbowe to the little Finger. And theſe two Bones be contained with the <hi>Adiutor</hi> bone, and be bound with ſtrong Ligaments, and in like manner with the Bones of the Hand. The which Bones bée numbred eight, the foure vppermoſt bée joyned with the foure nethermoſt towards the Hands: and in the third ward of Bones, bée fiue, and they are called <hi>Oſſa Patinis,</hi> and they are in the Palme of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99028:22"/>the hand. And to them be joyned the Bones of the Fingers and the Thumbes, as thus, in every Finger thrée Bones, and in the Thumbe two bones, (that is to ſay) the Fingers and Thumbe of euery hand fourtéene, called <hi>Oſſa digitorum:</hi> in the Palme of the Hand fiue, called <hi>Patinis,</hi> and betwéene the Hand and the Wriſt eight, called <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſete,</hi> and from the Wriſt to the ſhoulder, thrée Bones: all which being accounted together, yée ſhall find thirty bones in each Hand and Arme. To ſpeake of Sinewes, Ligaments, Cords, and Brawnes: here firſt ye ſhall vnderſtand, that there commeth from <hi>Mynuca,</hi> through the Spondels of the Necke, foure ſinewes, which moſt plainly doe appeare in ſight, as thus: one commeth into the vpper part of the Arme, another into the neather part, and one into the inner ſide, and another into the vtter ſide of the Arme, and they bring from the Braine, and from <hi>Mynuca,</hi> both féeling and mouing into the Armes, as thus: The ſinewes that come from the Braine and from the Marrow of the Backe that is called <hi>Mynuca,</hi> when they come to the junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſhoulder, there they are mixed with the Ligaments of the ſelfe ſhoulder, and there the Ligaments receiue both Féeling and mouing of them, and alſo in there medling together, they are made a Corde or a Tendon.</p>
               <p>Thrée cauſes I find why the ſinewes were medled with the Lygaments. The firſt cauſe is, that the littleneſſe of the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, which many wayes bée made weary by there continuall mooving, ſhould bée repreſſed by the inſenſibleneſſe of the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: The ſecond is, that the littleneſſe of the Sinewes ſhould bée through the quality of the Ligaments: The third is, the féebleneſſe of the Sinew, that is inſufficient, and too féeble to vſe his Office, but by the ſtrength and hardneſſe of the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Now to declare what a Cord is, what a Ligament, and what a Muſcle, or a Brawne, it is ynough rehearſed in the Chapter of the ſimple members: but if you will through the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Will or the Soule, draw the Arme to the hinder parts of the body, then the vtter Brawne is drawne together
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99028:22"/>and the inner inlarged, and likewiſe inwards, when the one Brawne doth draw inwards, the other doth ſtretch: and when the Arme is ſtretched in length, then the Cords be lengthened: but when they paſſe the juncture of the Shoulder and of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, by thrée fingers breadth or thereabout, then it is divided by ſubtill Will, and medled with the ſimple fleſh, and that which is made of it is called a Brawne. And thrée cauſes I finde, why that the ſimple fleſh is medled with the Corde in the compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Brawne.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that the aforeſaid Will might draw in quiet through the temperance of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that they temper and abate the drought of the Corde with his moyſtneſſe, the which drought he getteth thorow his manifold mouing. The third is, that the forme of the Brawne members ſhould be the more faire, and of better ſhape: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and Nature hath cloathed it with a Pannicle, that it might the better bée kept: And it is called of the Philoſophers, Muſculus, becauſe it hath a forme like vnto a Mouſe. And when theſe Brawnes coms néere a Ioynt, then the Chordes ſpring foorth of them, and are medled with the Ligaments againe, and ſo mooveth that Ioynt. And ſo yée ſhall vnderſtand, that alwayes betwéene every two Ioynts, is engendred a Brawne, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the ſame member and place, vnto the laſt extremity of the fingers, ſo that as well the leaſt juncture hath a proper fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and mooving when it néedeth, as hath the greateſt. And after <hi>Guido,</hi> there be numbred thirtéene in the Arme and Hand, as thus: foure in the Adjutor, mooving the vpper part of the Arme: and foure in the Focles, mooving the fingers. Now to ſpeake ſomewhat of the Veynes and Arteirs of the arme: it is to bée vnderſtood, that from <hi>Venakelis,</hi> there commeth two Branches, the one commeth to the one Arme-pit, and the other commeth to the other. And now marke the ſpreading, for as it is of the one, ſo it is of the other, as thus: when the branch is in the Arme-pit, there hée is divided into two branches: The one Branch goeth along in the inner ſide of the arme, vntill it come
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99028:23"/>to the bough of the Arme, and there it is called <hi>Bazilica,</hi> or <hi>Epatica,</hi> and ſo goeth downe the Arme till it come to the wriſt, and there it is turned to the backe of the Hand, and it is found betwéene the little finger and the next, and there it is called <hi>Salvatella.</hi> Now to the other Branch that is in the Arme-hole, which ſpreadeth to the vtter ſide of the ſhoulder, and there he divideth in two, the one goeth ſpreading vp into the carnous part of the Head, and after deſcendeth through the Bone into the Braine, as it is declared in the Anatomy of the head. The other branch goeth on the outward ſide of the Arme, and there he is divided into two alſo, the one part is ended at the hand, and the other part is folded about the arme till it appeare in the bouget of the arme, and there is called <hi>Sephalica,</hi> from thence it goeth to the backe of the hand, and appeareth betwéene the Thumbe and the foremoſt finger, and there it is called <hi>Sephalica Ocularis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two Branches that I ſpeake of, which be divided in the hinder part of the ſhoulders, from each of theſe two (I ſay ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth one, and thoſe two méete together and make one Veyne which appeareth in the bough of the Arme, and there it is called <hi>Mediana,</hi> or <hi>Coadialis,</hi> or <hi>Commine.</hi> And thus it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that of <hi>Vena Sephalica,</hi> ſpringeth <hi>Vena Ocularis,</hi> and of <hi>Vena Bazilica,</hi> ſpringeth <hi>Vena Salvatella,</hi> and of the two Veynes that méete, ſpringeth <hi>Vena Mediana,</hi> and in ramefying from theſe fiue principall Veynes ſpringeth innumerable, of the which a Chirurgion hath no great charge: for it ſufficeth vs to know the principals.</p>
               <p>To ſpeake of Arteirs, you ſhall vnderſtand, that whereſoever there is found a Veyne, there is an Arteir vnder him: and if there be found a great Veyne, there is found a great Artier, and whereas is a little Veyne, there is a little Artier: for whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer there goeth a Veyne to giue nutriment, there goeth an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier to bring the ſpirit of life. Wherefore it is to bée noted, that the Artiers lye more déeper in the fleſh then the Veynes doe: for they carry and kéepe in them more precious blood then doth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99028:23"/>the Veyne, and therefore hée hath néed to bée further from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers outwardly: and therefore, God and Nature haue ordained for him to be cloſed in two Coates, where the Veyne hath but one.</p>
               <p>The Breaſt of Thorax, is the Arke or Cheſt of the ſpirituall members of man, as ſaith the Philoſopher: where it is to bée noted, that there be foure things containing, and right contained, as thus. The foure containing, are, the Skinne, Muſculus fleſh, the Pappes and the Bones. The parts contained, are, the Heart, the Lunges, Pannicles, Lygaments, Nerues, Veynes, Artiers, Myre, or Iſofagus. Now the Skinne and the fleſh are knowne in their Anatomy. It is to be noted, that the fleſh of the Pappes, differeth from the other fleſh of the body: for it is white, glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulus, and ſpongeous: and there is in them, both Nerues, Veines, and Artiers, and by them they haue Coliganes with the Heart the Liver, the Braine, and the Generatiue members. Alſo there is in the Breaſt, as old Authors make mention, lxxx. or xc. Muſcles: for ſome of them be common to the Necke, ſome to the Shoulders, and to the Spades; ſome to Dyafragma or the Mydriffe: ſome to the Ribbes, ſome to the Backe, and ſome to the Breaſt it ſelfe. But I find certaine profitableneſſe in the creation of the Pappes, as well in man as in woman: for in man it defendeth the ſpirituals from annoyance outwardly: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their thickneſſe they comfort the naturall heate in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſpirits. And in women, there is the generation of Milke: for in women there commeth from the Matrix into their Breaſts many Veynes, which bring into them Menſtruall blood, the which is turned through the digeſtiue vertue, from red colour into white, like the colour of the Pappes, even as Chilley comming from the ſtomacke to the Liver, is turned into the colour of the Liver.</p>
               <p>Now to ſpeake of the Bones of the Breaſt: they bée ſaid to bée triple or thrée fold, and they be numbred to the ſeven in the Breaſt before, and their length<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s according to the breadth of the Breaſt, and there extremities or ends be griſtly, as the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99028:24"/>Ribbes be. And in the vpper end of Thorax is an hole or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavity in which is ſet the foot of the Furkle-bone or Cannel-bone, and in the nether end of Thorax, againſt the mouth of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, hangeth a a Griſtle called <hi>Enſiforme,</hi> and this Griſtle was ordained for two cauſes. One is, that it ſhould defend the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke from hurt outwardly. The ſecond is, that in time of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it ſhould giue place to the ſtomacke in time of néed when it deſireth, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now to ſpeake of the parts of the Backe behind foorth: There be twelue Spondels, through whom paſſeth <hi>Mynuca,</hi> of whom ſpringeth twelue paire of Nerues, bringeth bath fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and mooving to the Muſcles of the Breaſt aforeſayd. And héere it is to be noted, that in every ſide there be twelue Ribs, that is to ſay, ſeven true and fiue falſe, becauſe theſe fiue bée not ſo long as the other ſeven be: and therefore called falſe Ribs, as it may be perceived by the ſight of the Eye. Likewiſe, of the parts that be inwardly, and firſt of the Heart, becauſe hée is the principall of all other members, and the beginning of life: hée is ſet in the middeſt of the Breaſt ſeverally by himſelfe, as Lord and King of all members. And as a Lord or a King ought to be ſerved of his Subjects that haue their living of him, ſo are all other members of the Body ſubjects to the Heart: for they receiue their living of him, and they doe ſervice many wayes vnto him againe. The ſubſtance of the Heart is as it were La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zartus Fleſh, but it is ſpermaticke, and an officiall member, and the beginning of life, and hée giveth to every member of the Body, both blood of life, and ſpirit of breath, and heate: for if the Heart were of Lazartus fleſh, his mooving and ſtirring ſhould be voluntary and not naturall, but the contrary is true: for it were impoſſible that the Heart ſhould be ruled by Will onely, and not by Nature. The Heart hath the ſhape and forme of a Pine-apple, and the broad end thereof is vpwards, and the ſharpe end is downewards: depending a little towards the left ſide.</p>
               <p>And hée it is to be noted, that the Heart hath blood in his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99028:24"/>ſubſtance, whereas all other members haue it but in their Veines and Arteirs: Alſo the Heart is bound with certaine Ligaments to the backe part of the Breaſt, but theſe Lygaments touch not the ſubſtance of the Heart, but in the ouer-part they ſpring foorth of him, and is faſtened as a aforeſaid. Furthermore, the Heart hath two Ventricles, or Concavities, and the left is higher then the right, and the cauſe of his hollowneſſe, is this: For to kéepe the blood for his nouriſhing, and the ayre to abate and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the great heate that hée is in, the which is kept in Concavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Now héere it is to be noted, that to the right Ventrickle of the Heart, commeth a Veyne from the great Veyne called <hi>Vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelis,</hi> that receiveth all the ſubſtance of the blood from the Liver. And this Veyne that commeth from <hi>Venakelis,</hi> entreth into the heart of the right Ventricle, as I ſaid before, and in him is brought a great portion of the thickeſt blood to nouriſh the heart with, and the reſidue that is left of this, is made ſubtill through the vertue of the Heart, and then this Blood is ſent into a Concavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or pit in the midſt of the Heart, betwéene the two Ventricles, and therein it is made hot and pured, and then it paſſeth into the left Ventricle, and there is ingendred in it, a Spirit, that is clée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, brighter, and ſubtiller, then any Corporall or Bodily thing, that is engendred of the foure Elements: For it is a thing, that is a meane betwéene the Body and the Soule. Wherefore it is likened of the Philoſophers to be more liker heavenly things, then earthly things.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is to be noted, that from the left Ventricle of the heart ſpringeth two Arteirs: the one having but one Coate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called <hi>Arteria Venalis:</hi> And this Arteir carryeth Blood from the Heart to the Lungs, the which Blood is vaporous, that is tryed and left of the Heart, and is brought by this Artery to the Lungs, to giue him Nutriment, and there he receiveth of the Lungs ayre and bringeth it to the heart to refreſh him with.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth, that hée findeth that mans Heart is Naturall and friendly to the Lungs: For he giveth him of his owne Mutrimentall to nouriſh him with, and the Lungs reward
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99028:25"/>him with ayre, to refreſh him with againe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The other Artier that hath two Coates, is called <hi>Vena Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialis,</hi> or the Great Artery, that aſcendeth and diſcendeth, and of him ſpringeth all the other Arteirs that ſpred to euery member of the Body: for by him is vnited and quickned all the members of the Body. For the Spirit that is retained in them, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument or treaſure of all the vertue of the Soule. And thus it paſſeth vntill it come to the Braine, and there he is turned into a further digeſtion, and there hée taketh another Spirit, and ſo is made animall, and at the Liver nutrimentall, and at the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtikles generatiue: and thus it is made a ſpirit of euery kind, ſo that hée being meane of all manner operations and workings, taketh effect. Two cauſes I find why theſe Arteirs haue two Coates. One is, that one Coate is not ſufficient, nor able to withſtand the violent mooving and ſtirring of the Spirit of life, that is carryed in them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe is, that the thing that is carryed about from place to place, is of ſo precious a Treaſure, that it had the more néed of good kéeping. And of ſome Doctors, this Artier is called the Pulſatiue Veyne, or the beating Veyne: for by him is percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the power and might of the Heart, &amp;c. Wherefore God and Nature haue ordained, that the Arteirs haue two Coates. Alſo there is in the Heart thrée Pellikles, opening and cloſing the going in of the Heart blood, and ſpirit in convenient time. Alſo the Heart hath two little Eares, by whom commeth in and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth out the Ayre that is prepared for the Lungs. Alſo there is found in the Heart a Cartilaginous Auditament, to helpe and ſtrengthen the ſelfe Heart. Alſo the Heart is covered with a ſtrong Pannicle, which is called of ſome <hi>Capſula Cordes,</hi> or <hi>Paricordium,</hi> the which is a ſtrong caſe, vnto whom commeth Nerues, as to other inward members. And this Pannicle <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordium,</hi> ſpringeth of the vpper Pannicle of the Midriffe. And of him ſpringeth another Pannicle called <hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> the which departeth the Breaſt in the midſt, and kéepeth that the Lungs fall not over the Heart. Alſo there is another Pannicle that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99028:25"/>the Ribs inwardly, that is called <hi>Plura,</hi> of whom the Midriffe taketh his beginning. And it is ſaid of many Doctors, that <hi>Duramater</hi> is the Originall of all the Pannicles within the Body: and thus one taketh of another.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. The Anatomy of the Lungs.</head>
               <p>THE Lungs is a member Spermatick of the firſt Creation, and his naturall complexion is cold and dry, and in his acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall complexion he is cold and moyſt, lapped in a Neruous Pannicle, becauſe it ſhould gather together the ſofter ſubſtance of the Lungs, and that the Lungs might féele by the meanes of the Pannicle, that which he might not féele in himſelfe. Now to proue the Lungs to bée cold and dry of kind, it appeareth by his ſwift ſtirring. for hée lyeth ever waving ouer the Heart, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Heart. And that hée is cold and moyſt in reward, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth well, that he receiveth of the Braine many cold matters, as Cataries and Rheumes, whoſe ſubſtance is thinne. Alſo I find in the Lungs thrée kinds of ſubſtance. One is a Veyne comming from the Liver, bringing with him the Crude or raw part of the Chylle, to féed the Lungs. Another is <hi>Arteria Venealis,</hi> comming from the Heart, bringing with him the ſpirit of life to nouriſh him with. The third is <hi>Trachia Arteria,</hi> that bringeth in ayre to the Lungs, and it paſſeth through all the left part of them to doe his Office.</p>
               <p>The Lungs is divided into fiue Lobbes or Pellikeles, or fiue portions (that is to ſay) thrée in the right ſide, and two in the left ſide. And this was done for this cauſe, that if there fell any hurt in the one part, the others ſhould ſerue and doe their office. And thrée cauſes I find, why the Lungs were principally ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Firſt, that they ſhould draw cold wind, and refreſh the Heart. The ſecond, that they ſhould change and alter, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99028:26"/>the ayre before it come to the Heart, leſt the heart were hurt and annoyed with the quantity of the ayre. The third cauſe is, that they ſhould receiue from the heart the fumous ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that he putteth foorth with his breathing, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Behind the Lungs, toward the Spondels, paſſeth Myre or Iſofagus, of whom it is ſpoken of in the Anatomy of the Necke. And alſo there paſſeth both Veynes and Arteirs, and all theſe with <hi>Trachia Arteria,</hi> doe make a Stoke, replete vnto the Gullet, with the Pannicles, and ſtrong Ligaments, and Glandulus fleſh to fulfill the voyd places. And laſt of all: is the Midriffe, and it is an officiall member made of two Pannicles and Lazartus fleſh, and his place is in the midſt of the body, over-thwart or in breath vnder the region of the Spirituall members, departing them from the <hi>Matrix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And three cauſes I find, why the Midriffe was ordained. Firſt, that it would divide the Spirituals from the Nutrates. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that it ſhould kéepe the vitall colour or heat to deſcend down to the Nutrates. The laſt is, that the malicious fumes reared vp from the Nutrates, ſhould not noy the Spirituals or vitals, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The wombe is the Region or the City of all the Intrails, the which reacheth from the Midriffe downe vnto the ſhare inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and outwardly from the Reynes or Kidneyes, downe to the bone Pe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ten, about the priuy parts. And this Wombe is compound and made of two things (that is to ſay) of <hi>Syfac,</hi> and <hi>Myrac; Syfac</hi> is a Pannicle, and a member ſpermaticke, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, ſenſible, Sinowie, compound of ſubtill Will, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion cold and dry, having his beginning in the inner Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of the Midriffe. And it was ordained, becauſe it ſhould containe and bind together all the Intrailes, and that he defend the Muſculus, ſo that he oppreſſe not the Naturall members. And that he is ſtrong and tough, it is becauſe he ſhould not be lightly broken, and not thoſe things that are contained goe not foorth, as it happeneth to them that are broken, &amp;c. <hi>Myrac</hi> is compound, and made of foure things (that is to ſay) of Skinne outwardly of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99028:26"/>Fatneſſe, of a Carnous Pannicle and of Muſculus Fleſh. And that it is to bée vnderſtanded, that all the whole from <hi>Syfac</hi> outward, is called <hi>Myrac,</hi> it appeareth well (by the words of <hi>Galen</hi>) where hée commandeth, that in all wounds of the Wombe, to ſewe the <hi>Syfac,</hi> with the <hi>Mirac,</hi> and by that it proveth, that there is nothing without the <hi>Syfac</hi> but <hi>Mirac.</hi> And in this <hi>Mirac,</hi> or vtter part of the Wombe, there is noted eight Muſcles, two Longitudinals, procéeding from the ſhéeld of the ſtomacke, vnto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Os Pecten:</hi> two Latitudinals comming from the backwards to the Wombe: and foure Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, of the which, two of them ſpring from the Ribbes on the right ſide, and goe to the left ſide, to the Bones of the Hanches, or of Pecten: and the other two ſpring from the Ribs on the left, and come over the wombe to the right parts, as the other before doth.</p>
               <p>Héere is to be noted, that by the vertue of the ſubtill will that is in the Muſculus Longitudinall, is made perfect the vertue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiue: and by the Muſculus Tranſverſe, is made the vertue retentius: and by the Muſculus Latitudinall, is made the vertue expulſiue. It is thus to be vnderſtood, that by the vertue attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, is drawne downe into the Intrales, all ſuperfluities, both water, winde, and dyet. By the vertue retentiue, all things are with-holden and kept, vntill Nature haue wrought his kind. And by the vertue expulſiue is put forth all things, when Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voketh any thing to be done. <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith that wounds or inciſions be more perilous in the midſt of the wombe, then about the ſides, for there the parts be more tractable then any other parts bée. Alſo he ſaith, that in wounds piercing the wombe there ſhall not bée made good incarnation, except <hi>Sifac</hi> be ſewed with <hi>Mirac.</hi> Now to come to the parts contained within: Firſt, that which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth next vnder the <hi>Sifac</hi> is <hi>Omentum</hi> or <hi>Zirbus,</hi> the which is a Pannicle covering the ſtomacke and the Intrailes, unyla<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with many Veynes and Arteirs, and not a little fatneſſe ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to kéepe moyſt the inward parts.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Zirbus</hi> is an officiall member, and is compound of a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99028:27"/>Veyne and an Arteir, the which entreth and maketh a line of the vtter Tunicle of the ſtomacke, vnto which Tunicle hangeth the <hi>Zirbus,</hi> and covereth all the Guts downe to the ſhare.</p>
               <p>Two cauſes I find, why they were ordained. One is, that they ſhould defend the Nutratiues outwardly. The ſecond is, that through his owne power and vertue, he ſhould ſtrengthen and comfort the digeſtion of all the Nutrates, becauſe they are more féebler then other members bée, becauſe they haue but a thinne wombe or Skin, &amp;c. Next <hi>Zirbus</hi> appeareth the Intrails or guts of which <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that the Guts were ordained in the firſt Creation to convey the droſſe of the meate and drinke, and to clenſe the body of their ſuperfluities. And here it is to be noted, that there be fixe portions of one whole Gutte, which both in man and Beaſt beginneth at the nether mouth of the ſtomacke, and ſo containeth foorth to the end of the Fundament. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe hée hath divers ſhapes and formes, and divers operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Body, and therefore hée hath divers names. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Philoſophers ſay, that the lower wombe of a man, is like vnto the wombe of a Swine. And like as the ſtomacke hath two Tunicles, in like manner haue all the Guts two Tunicles. The firſt portion of the Guts is called <hi>Duodenum;</hi> for he is 12. Inches of length, and covereth the nether part of the ſtomacke, and receiveth all the droſſe of the ſtomacke: the ſecond portion of the Guts is called <hi>Iejunium,</hi> for he is evermore empty, for to him lyeth evermore the Cheſt of the Gall, beating him ſore, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth of him all the droſſe, and clenſeth him cleane: the third portion or Gut, is called <hi>Yleon,</hi> or ſmall Gut, and is in length fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene or ſixtéene Cubits. In this Gut oftentimes falleth a diſeaſe called <hi>Yleaca Paſſio.</hi> The fourth Gut is called <hi>Monoculus,</hi> or blind Gut, and it ſéemeth to haue but one hole or mouth, but it hath two, one néere vnto the other, for by the one all things goe in, and by the other they goe out againe. The fift is called <hi>Colon,</hi> and receiveth all the droſſe deprived from all profitableneſſe, and therefore there commeth not to him any Veynes <hi>Miſeraices,</hi> as to the other. The ſixt and laſt, is called <hi>Rectum</hi> or <hi>Longaon,</hi> and hée
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99028:27"/>heis ended in the Fundament, and hath in his nether end foure <hi>Muſcles,</hi> to hold, to open, to ſhut, and to put out, &amp;c. Next is to be noted of <hi>Menſenterium,</hi> the which is nothing elſe but a tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of inmunerable Veynes <hi>Miſer<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ices,</hi> ramefied of one Veyne called <hi>Porta Epates,</hi> covered and defended of Pannicles and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments comming to the Intrails, with the backe full of farneſſe and Glandulus fleſh, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſtomacke is a member compound and Spermaticke, ſin<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>wy and ſenſible, and therein is made perfect the firſt dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of Chile. This is a neceſſary member to all the Body, for if it faile in his working, all the members of the Body ſhall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth, that the ſtomacke was ordained principally for two cauſes. The firſt, that it ſhould be to all the members of the Body, as the earth is to all that are ingendred of the earth, that is, that it ſhould deſire ſufficient meate for all the whole Body. The ſecond is, that the ſtomacke ſhould bée a ſacke or Cheſt to all the Body for the meate; and as a Cooke to all the members of the Body. The ſtomacke is made of two Pannicles, of which the inner is <hi>Nerveous,</hi> and the vtter <hi>Carneous.</hi> This inner Pannicle hath <hi>Muſculus</hi> Longitudinals, that ſtretcheth along from the ſtomacke to the mouth, by the which he draweth to him meate and drinke, as it were hands. And hée hath Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe will, for to with-hold or make retention. And alſo the vtter Pannicle hath Latitudinall will, to expulſe and put out: and that by his heate he ſhould kéepe the digeſtiue vertue of the ſtomacke, and by other heates given by his Neighbours, as thus. It hath the Liver on the right ſide, chaſing and beating him with his lobes or figures: and the Splene on the left ſide, with his fatneſſe and Veynes, ſending to him Melancholy, to exerciſe his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites: and about him is the heart, quickning him with his <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rtiers:</hi> Alſo the Braine ſending to him a Branch of <hi>Nerues</hi> to giue him féeling. And he hath on the hinder part, deſcending from the parts of the backe many <hi>Lygaments,</hi> with the <hi>Artiers</hi> joyned to the Spondels of the Backe. The forme or figure of this ſtomacke is

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:99028:29"/>long, in likeneſſe of a Goorde, crooked: and that both holes bée in the vpper part of the body of it, becauſe there ſhould be no going out of it vnadviſedly of thoſe things which are received into it. The quantity of the ſtomack commonly holdeth two Pitchers of water, and it may ſuffer many paſſions, and the nother mouth of the ſtomacke is narrower then the vpper, and that for thrée cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The firſt cauſe is, that the vpper receiveth meate great and boyſterous in ſubſtance, that there being made ſubtill, it might paſſe into the nether. The ſecond is, for by him paſſeth all the meates, with their chiloſity from the ſtomacke to the Liver. The third is, for that through him paſſeth all the droſſe of the ſtomack to the guts. And this ſufficeth for the ſtomacke, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Liver is a principle member, and officiall, and of his firſt creation ſpermaticke, complete in quantity of blood, of himſelfs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, but by accidence he is inſenſible, and in him is made the ſecond digeſtion, and is lapped in a ſinowie Pannicle.</p>
               <p>And that he is a principle member, it appeareth onely by the Philoſophers, by <hi>Avicen</hi> and <hi>Galen.</hi> And it is officiall as is the ſtomacke, and it is of ſpermatick matter, and ſinowie of the which is ingendred his Veines. And becauſe it was like in quantity, Nature hath added to it crudded blood, to the accompliſhment of ſufficient quantity, and is lapped in a ſinowie Pannicle. And why the Liver is crudded, is becauſe the Chile which commeth from the ſtomacke to the Liver, ſhould be turned into the colour of blood.</p>
               <p>And why the Liver was ordained, was becauſe that all the nutrimentall blood bée engendred in him. The proper place of the Liver is vnder the falſe Ribbes in the right ſide. The forme of the Liver is gibbous or bunchie on the backe ſide, and it is ſomewhat hollow like the inſide of an hand. And why it is ſo ſhapen, is, that it ſhould bée plyable to ſtomacke, like as a hand doth to an Apple, to comfort her digeſtion, for his heate is to the ſtomacke, as the heate of the fire is to the Pot or Cauldron that hangeth over it.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Lungs is bound with his Pellikles to the Diafrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99028:29"/>and with ſtrong Ligaments. And alſo hée hath Coliganes with the ſtomacke and the Intrailes, and with the Heart and the Reynes, the Teſtikles and other members. And there are in him fiue Pellikles, like fiue fingers. <hi>Galen</hi> calleth the Liver <hi>Meſſa Sanguinaria,</hi> containing in it ſelfe foure ſubſtances. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Nutrimentall. The Naturals is ſent with the blood to all parts of the body, to be engendred and nouriſhed. And the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimentals be ſequeſtrate and ſent to places ordained for ſome hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings. Theſe are the places of the Humours, the blood in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Choller in the Cheſt or Gall, Melancholy to the Splene, Flegme to the Lungs and the Iunctures, the watery ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Reynes and Veſike. And they goe with the Blood, and ſometime they putrifie and make Fevers, and ſome bée put out to the Skinne, and bée roſolved by ſweat, or by Scabs, by Puſhes, or by Impoſtumes.</p>
               <p>And theſe foure naturall Humours (that is to ſay) Sanguine, Choler, Melancholy, and Flegme, be engendred and diſtributed in this manner: Firſt, yée ſhall vnderſtand, that from the Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke matter of the Liver inwardly, there is engendred two great Veynes, of the which, the firſt and the greateſt is called <hi>Porta,</hi> and commeth from the concavity of the Liver, of whom ſpringeth all the ſmall Veynes <hi>Miſeraices:</hi> and theſe <hi>Miſeraices,</hi> be to <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> as the branches of a Trée bée to the ſtocke of a Trée. For ſome of them bée contained with the bottome of the ſtomacke: ſome with <hi>Duodenum,</hi> ſome with <hi>Jejunium,</hi> ſome with <hi>Yleon,</hi> and ſome with <hi>Monoculus,</hi> or <hi>Saccus.</hi> And from all theſe Guts they bring to <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> the ſuccoſity of Chiley, going from the ſtomacke, and diſtribute it into the ſubſtance of the Liver. And theſe Veynes <hi>Miſeraices,</hi> be innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable. And in theſe Veynes begun the ſecond Digeſtion, and ended in the Liver, like as it is in the ſtomacke the firſt Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>So it proveth that <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> and <hi>Vena Miſeraices,</hi> ſerue to bring all the ſuccozity of all the meate and drink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that paſſeth the ſtomacke to the Liver, and they ſpread themſelves thorough
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99028:30"/>the ſubſtance of the Liver inwardly, and all they ſtretch towards the gibous (or bowing part of the Liver,) and there they méete, and goe all into one Vnity, and make the ſecond great Veyne, called <hi>Vena Ulis,</hi> or <hi>Concava,</hi> or <hi>Vena Ramoſa:</hi> all is one, and he with his Rootes draweth out all the bloud engendred from the Liver, and with his branches Ramefying vpwards and downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, carryeth and convayeth it to all other Members of the Body to bée nouriſhed with, where is made perfect the third di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. And alſo there goeth from the Liver Veynes, bearing the ſuperfluites of the third Digeſtion to their proper places, as it ſhall be declared hereafter. Now to ſpeake of the Gall, or of the Cheſt of the Gall: It is an officiall member, and it is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke and ſinowie, and hath in it a ſubtiill Will, and it is a purſe or a Panniculer Veſikle in the hollowneſſe of the Liver, about the middle Pericle or Lobe, ordained to receiue the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke ſuperfluities which are engendred in the Liver: The which purſe or bagge hath thrée holes or Neckes; By the firſt hée draweth to him from the Liuer the Choller, that the Blood be not hurt by the Choller. By the ſecond Necke hée ſendeth to the bottome of the ſtomacke Choler, the further the Digeſtion of the ſtomacke. And by the third<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Necke hée ſendeth the Choler regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly from one Gut to another, to clenſe them of their ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Droſſe: and the quantity of the purſe, may containe in it halfe a pinte, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And next is the Splene, or the milte, the which is a ſuperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke member, as are other members: and officiall, and is the receptory of the Melancholious ſuperfluities that are engendred in the Liues: and his place is on the left ſide, tranſverſly linked to the ſtomacke, and his ſubſtance is thinne. And two cauſes I finde, why he was ordained there. The firſt is, that by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholius ſuperfluities which are engendred of the Liver which hée draweth to him hée is nouriſhed with. The ſecond cauſe is, that the nutritiue Blood ſhould by him be made the more purer, and cleane, from the Droſſe and thicking of the Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>And next of the Reynes and Kidneyes: It is to be vnderſtood that within the Region of the Nutrites backwards, are ordained the Kidneyes to clenſe the Blood from the watery ſuperfluities, and they haue each of them two paſſages or holes, or Neckes: By the one is drawne the water from <hi>Venakelis,</hi> by two Veyns, which are called <hi>Vencae Aemulgentes,</hi> the length of the finger of a man, and iſſueth from the Liver: and by the other is ſent the ſame water to the Bladder, and is called <hi>Poros Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of the Kidneyes is <hi>Lazartus</hi> Fleſh, having Longitudinall will, and their place is behinde, on each ſide of the Spondels, and they are two in number, and the right Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney lyeth ſomewhat higher then the left, and is bound faſt to the backe with Lygaments. The Philoſopher ſaith that mans Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes are like the Kidneyes of a Cow, full of hard Concavities, and therefore the ſores of them are hard to cure. Alſo they are more harder in ſubſtance, then any other fleſhly member, and that for two cauſes. One is, that hée bée not much hurt of the ſharpeneſſe of the Vrine. The other is, that the ſame Vrine that paſſeth from him, might the better be altered and clenſed through the ſame. Alſo there commeth from the heart to each of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, an Artier, that bringeth with him Blood, heat, ſpirit, and Life. And in the ſame manner there commeth a Veyne from the Liver, that bringeth blood to nouriſh the Kidneyes, called Blood Nutrimentall.</p>
               <p>The greaſe of the Kidneyes or Fatneſſe, is as of other inward members, but it is an officiall member, made of thinne Blood, c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now by the Kidneyes vpon the Spondels, paſſeth <hi>Venakelis;</hi> or <hi>Venacua,</hi> which is a Veyne of great ſubſtance: for he receiveth all the Nutrimentall blood from the Liver, and from him paſſeth many ſmall Pipes on every ſide, and at the Spondell betwéene
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99028:31"/>the ſhoulders, he divideth himſelfe whole in two great branches, the one goeth into the one arme, and the other into the other, and there they divide themſelves into many Veynes and branches, as is declared in the armes.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. The Anatomie of the Haunches and their parts.</head>
               <p>THE Haunches are the lower part of the Wombe, joyning to the Thighs and the ſecret members. And thrée things there are to be noted thereof. The firſt is of the parts containing: the ſecond is of the parts contained, and the third is of the parts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding outwards.

And firſt of the parts containing: as of <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac, Syfac,</hi> and <hi>Zirbus,</hi> there is enough ſpoken of in the Anatomy of the Wombe. But as for the Bones of the Hanches, there bée the parts of the backe thrée Spondels of <hi>Oſſa ſacri,</hi> or of the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: and thrée <hi>Caitailiginis</hi> Spondels of <hi>Oſſa Cande,</hi> called the Taile-bone.</p>
               <p>And thus it is proved, that there is in every man thirty Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and thus they are to be numbred: in the Necke ſeaven, in the Ridge twelue; in the Reynes fiue: and in the Hanches ſixe: And it is to be noted, that every Spondell is hollow in the middeſt: through which hollowneſſe paſſeth <hi>Nuca</hi> from the Braine, or the Marrow of the Backe. And ſome Authors ſay, that <hi>Mynuca</hi> is of the ſubſtance that the Braine is of: For it is like in ſubſtance, and in it ſelfe giveth to the Nerues both the ver<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:99028:31"/>
               <p>And alſo every Spondell is holden on every ſide, through the which holes, both Arteirs and Veynes doe bring from the Heart and the Liver both Life and nouriſhment, like as they doe to the Braine: and from the Pannicle of <hi>Mynuca,</hi> or the Marrow of the backe, through the holes of the ſides of the Spondels, ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth foorth Nerues motiues, and there they entermeddle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the ſtrong Lygaments that be inſenſible, and ſo the Lygaments receiue that féeling of the Nerue, which the Nerues taketh of <hi>Mynuca.</hi> And by this reaſon many Authors prooue, that <hi>Mynuca</hi> is of the ſame ſubſtance that the Braine is of, and the Pannicles of the <hi>Nuca</hi> is of the ſame ſubſtance of the Pannicles of the Braine, &amp;c. And each of theſe Spondels bée bound faſt one with another, ſo that one of them may not well bée named with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out another. And ſo all theſe Spondels together, contained one by another are called the Ridge-bone, which is the foundation of all the ſhape of the Body. They with the laſt Spondell be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained or joyned to the Bones of the Hanches, and they be the vpholders of all the Spondels. And theſe Bones bée ſmall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Tale bone, and abroad towards the Hanches, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they joyne and make <hi>Os Pectinis.</hi> And ſo they bée broad in the parts of the Iles, and therefore ſome Authors calleth it <hi>Ilea.</hi> And each of theſe two Bones towards the Liver hath a great round hole, into which is received the Bone called <hi>Vertebra,</hi> or the Whorlebone. Alſo beſides that place there is a great hole or way, thorow the which paſſeth from aboue Muſculus Veynes and Artiers, and goe into the Thighes. And thus it is to bée noted, that of this Bone <hi>Pecten,</hi> and the Bone <hi>Vertebra,</hi> is made the juncture of the Thigh.</p>
               <p>Now to ſpeake of the parts contained, the firſt thing that commeth to ſight is the Bladder, the which is an officiall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, compound of two Nervous Pannicles, in complexion cold and dry, whoſe Necke is carnous, and hath Muſcles to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and to let goe: and in man it is long, and is contained with the yard, paſſing through <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> but in women it is ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and is contained with the <hi>Vulua.</hi> The place of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99028:32"/>is betwéene the bone of the Share and the Tayle-gut, called <hi>Longaon,</hi> and in women, it is betwéene the aforeſaid bone and the Matrix.</p>
               <p>And in it is implanted two long veſſels comming from the Kidneyes, whoſe names be <hi>Porri Urikcides,</hi> bringing with them the Vrine or water from the Kidneys to the Bladder, which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily entreth into the holes of the Pannicles of the Bladder, by a naturall mooving betwéene Tunicle and Tunicle, and there the Vrine findeth the hole of the nether Tunicle, and there it entreth privily into the concavity of the bladder, and the more that the Bladder is filled with Vrine, the ſtraiter bée the two Pannicles compriſed together, for the holes of the Tunicles be not even one againſt another, and therefore if the bladder be never ſo full, there may none goe backe againe. The forme of it is round, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it is a Pitcher full, in ſome more, in ſome leſſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Alſo there is found two other veſſels, called <hi>Vaza Seminaria,</hi> or the Spermaticke Veſſels. And they come from <hi>Venakelis,</hi> bringing blood to the Toſtikles, as well in man, as in woman, the which by his further digeſtion it is made ſperme or nature in men: they be put outward, for the Teſtikles be without, but in women it abideth within, for there Teſtikles ſtand within: as it ſhall be declared hereafter.</p>
               <p>Next followeth the Matrix in women: the Matrix in women is an officiall member, compound and Nerveous, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion cold and dry: and it is the field of mans genertion, and it is an inſtrument ſuſceptiue, that is to ſay, a thing receiving or taking: and her proper place is betwéne the Bladder and the Gut <hi>Longaon,</hi> the likeneſſe of it, is as it were a yard reverſed and turned inward, having Teſtikles likewiſe, as aforeſaid. Alſo the Matrix hath two Concavities or Selles, and no more, but all Beaſtes haue as many Selles as they haue Pappes heads. Alſo it hath a long Necke like an Vrinall, and in every Necke it hath a mouth, that is to ſay, one within, and another without. The inner in the time of conception is ſhut, and the vtter part is open as it was before: and it hath in the middeſt a Lazartus Panni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99028:32"/>which is called in Latine <hi>Tengito:</hi> And in the creation of this Pannicle, is found two vtilities. The firſt is, that by it goeth forth the Vrine, or elſe it ſhould bée ſhed throughout all the <hi>Vulva:</hi> The ſecond is, that when a woman doth ſet her Thighs abroad, it altereth the ayre that commeth to the Matrix for to temper the heate.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Necke that is betwéene theſe two aforeſaid mouthes, in her concavity hath many involuſions and pleates, joyned together in the manner of Roſe leaues before they be fully ſpread or ripe, and ſo they be ſhut together as a purſe mouth, ſo that nothing may paſſe forth but vrine, vntill the time of childing. Alſo about the middle of this necke be certaine Veynes in May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, the which in time of deflowring, be corrupted and broken. Furthermore, in the ſides of the vtter mouth, are two Teſticles or Stones, and alſo two veſſels of Sperme, ſhorter then mans veſſels, and in time of Coyt the Womans ſperme is ſhead downe in the bottome of the Matrix. Alſo from the Liver there commeth to the Matrix many Veynes, bringing to the Child nouriſhing at the time of a womans being with Child: and theſe Veynes, at ſuch time as the Matrix is voyd, bring thereto ſuperfluities from certaine members of the Body, whereof are engendred wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Flowers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And foraſmuch as it hath pleaſed Almighty God to giue the knowledge of theſe his Miſteries and Workes vnto his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in this preſent World. Héere I <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ing Embreon is, and his Creation. The noble Philoſophers, as <hi>Galen, Avicen, Bartholmeus,</hi> and divers others, writing vpon this matter, ſay: That Embreon is a thing engendred in the Mothers wombe, the originall whereof is, the Sperme of the Man and of the Woman, of the which is made by the might and power of GOD, in the mothers wombe a Child: as hereafter more at large ſhall bée declared. Firſt, the field of Generation called the Matrix, or the Mother, is knowne in the Anatomy, whoſe place is properly (betwixt the Bladder and Longaon) in the Woman, in which place is ſowne by the Tillage of man, a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99028:33"/>covenable matter of kindly heate: For kindly heate is cauſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient both of doing and working, and Spirit that giveth vertue to the Body, and governeth and ruleth that vertue: the which Séed of generation commeth from all the parts of the Body, both of the Man and Woman, with conſent and will of all Members, and is ſhead in the plac<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of Conceiving, where tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the vertue of Nature, it is gathered together in the Celles of the Matrix or the Mother, in whom by the way of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of mans Séede, and by the way of ſuffering of the Womans Séed mixt together, ſo that each of them worketh in other, and ſuffereth in other, there is engendred Embreon. And further it is to bée noted, that this Sperme that commeth both to man and woman, is made and gathered of the moſt beſt and pureſt drops of Blood in all the body, and by the labour and cha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And in man it is hot, white, and thicke: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may not ſpread nor runne abroad of it ſelfe, but runneth and taketh temperance of the Womans ſperme which hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary qualities: For the womans ſperme is thinner, colder, and féebler.</p>
               <p>And as ſome Authors hold opinion, when this matter is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into the right ſide of the Matrix, then it happeneth a Male kind, and likewiſe on the left the Female, and where the vertue is moſt, there it favoureth moſt. And further it is to bée noted, that like as the Renet of the Chéeſe hath by himſelfe the way or vertue of working, ſo hath the Milke by way of ſuffering: and as the Renet and milke make the Chéeſe, ſo doth the ſperme of Man and Woman make the generation of Embreon, of the which thing ſpringeth (by the vertue of kindly heate) a certaine Skin or Caule, into the which it lappeth it ſelfe in, wherewith afterwards it is tyed to the Mothers wombe, the which covering commeth foorth with the byrth of the Childe: and if it happen that any of the Skinne remaine after the byrth of the Child, th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> is the Woman in perill of her life.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, (if is ſaid) that of this Embreon is ingendred
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99028:33"/>the Heart, the Liver, the Braynes, Nerues, Veynes, Arteirs, Cords, Lygaments, Skins, Griſtles, and Bones, receiving to them by kindly vertue the menſtruall blood, of which is engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred both fleſh and fatneſſe. And as writers ſay, the firſt thing that is ſhapen, be the principals: as is the Heart, Liver, and Braine. For of the Heart ſpringeth the Artiers: of the Liver, the Veines: and of the Brain, the Nerues: and when theſe are made, Nature maketh and ſhapeth both Bones and Griſtles to kéepe and ſaue them, as the bones of the head for the Brain: the Breaſt Bones, and the Ribbes, for the Heart and the Liver. And after theſe ſpringeth all other members one after another: and thus is the Child bred forth in foure degrées, as thus. The firſt is, when the ſaid Sperme or Séed is at the firſt as it were Milke. The ſecond is, when it is turned from that kind into another kind, is yet but as a lumpe of Blood, and this is called of <hi>Ipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cras, Fettus.</hi> The third degrée is, when the principals be ſhapen as the Heart, Liver, and Brains. The fourth and laſt, as when all the other members bée perfectly ſhapen, then if receiveth the Soule, with Life and Breath, and then it beginneth to moue it ſelfe alone, Now in theſe foure degrées aforeſaid, in the firſt as Milke, it continueth ſevendayes: in the ſecond as <hi>Fettus,</hi> nine dayes: in the third, as a lumpe of Fleſh engendring the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals the ſpace of nine dayes: and the fourth vnto the time fo full perfection of all the whole members, is the ſpace of eightéene dayes: So is there ſixe and forty dayes from the day of Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vnto the day of full perfection and receiving of the Soule, as God beſt knoweth.</p>
               <p>Now to come againe to the Anatomy of the Haunches: Then come wée to <hi>Longaon,</hi> otherwiſe called the Taile-gut, whoſe ſubſtance is Pannicular, as of all the other Bowels: the length of it is of a ſpan long ſtretching nigh to the Reynes, his nether part is called <hi>Annis,</hi> (that is to ſay) the towell: and about him is found two Muſcles, the one to open, the other to ſhut. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there is found in him fiue Veynes or Branches of Veynes, called <hi>Venae Emoraidales,</hi> and they haue Colliganes with the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99028:34"/>Bladder: whereof they are partners in their grieues.</p>
               <p>And when this <hi>Longaon</hi> is raiſed vp, then yée may ſée the Veynes and Artiers, and Sinewes, how they bée branched and bound down to the nether parts: the parts procéeding outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are <hi>Didimus Peritoneum,</hi> the Yard, the Teſtlkles, and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks. And firſt, it ſhall be ſpoken of the Yard, or of mans gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue members, the which dureth vnto that part that is called <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoneum,</hi> the which place is from the Coddes, vnto the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereupon is a ſe<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The Yard is an officiall member, and the Tiller of mans ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, compound, and made of Skin, Brawnes, Tendons, Veynes, Arteirs, Sinewes, and great Lygaments: and it hath in it two paſſages, or principall iſſue, one for the Sperme, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for the Vrine. And as the Philoſophers ſay, the quantity of a common yard, is eight or nine Inches, with meaſurable big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe proportioned to the quantity of the Matrix.</p>
               <p>This member hath (as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith) thrée holes, through one paſſeth inſenſible poliſions and wind, that cauſeth the Yard to riſe: the other two holes is declared before. Alſo the yard hath a Skinne, and about the head thereof, it is double, and that men call <hi>Praeputium;</hi> and this Skinne is moueable, for through his conſecration the Spermaticke matter is the better, and ſooner ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and ſooner caſt foorth from the Teſtikles: for by him, is bad the moſt delectation in the dooing. And the foremoſt part of the head of the Yard before, is made of a brawny fleſh, the which if it bée once loſt, it is never reſtored againe, but it may be well ſkinned, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Coddes is a compound member, and an officiall, and though it bée counted amongſt the generatiue members, yet it is called a principall member, becauſe of generation. This Purſe was ordained for the cuſtody and comfort of the Teſtikles and other Spermaticke veſſels: and it is alſo made of two parts, of the inner and of the vtter.</p>
               <p>The vtter is compound and made of Skinne, and Lazartus.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99028:34"/>Longitudinall and Tranſverſall, in like manner as the <hi>Myrac.</hi> The inner part of the Cods is of the ſubſtance of the <hi>Sifac,</hi> and are in ſimilitude as two pockets drawne together by themſelues, and they differ not from the <hi>Syfac:</hi> and there bée two, becauſe if there fall any hurt to the one, the other ſhould ſerue. The Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtikles or ſtones bée two, made of Glandulus fleſh, or Curnelly fleſh. And furthermore, through the <hi>Didimus,</hi> commeth the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtikles from the Braine, Sinewes, and from the Heart Artiers and from the Liver Veynes, bringing vnto them both féeling and ſtirring, Life, and Spirit, and Nutrimentall blood, and the moſt pureſt blood of all other members of the Body, whereof is made the Sperme by the labour of the Teſtikles, the which is put forth in due time, as is before rehearſed.</p>
               <p>The Groynes bée knowne: they bée the empty Iunctures, or purging place vnto the Liver, and they haue curnelly fleſh in the plying or bowing of the Thighes.

               <p>THE Legge reacheth from the Ioynt of the Thigh vnto the extremity of the Toes, and I will divide it in parts, as the Armes were divided. One part is called <hi>Coxa,</hi> or Thigh, and that is all that is contained from the joynt of the Haunch vnto the Knée. The ſecond part is called <hi>Tibia,</hi> and that reacheth from the Knée to the Ankle. The third is the little foote, and that is from the Ankle, vnto the end of the Toes. And héere it is to bée noted, that the Thigh, Leg, and foote, are compound, and made as the great Arme or hand, with Skin, Fleſh, Veynes, Artiers,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99028:35"/>Sinewes, Brawnes, Tendons, and Bones, whereof they are to be ſpoken of in order.</p>
               <p>Of the Skinne and Fleſh there is enough ſpoken of before. And as of Veynes and Arteirs in their deſcending downwards, of the laſt Spondels they bée divided into two parts, whereof the one part goeth into the right Thigh, and the other into the Left: And when they come to the Thigh, they be divided in other two great Branches: the one of them ſpreadeth into the inner ſide of the Legge, and the other ſpreadeth into the vtter ſide, and ſo bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, deſcend downe to the Legge, to the Ankles, and Féete, and be brought into foure Veynes, which be commonly vſed in letting Blood, as hereafter followeth.</p>
               <p>One of them is vnder the inner Ankle toward the héele, called <hi>Soffena,</hi> and another vnder the vnder Ankle, called <hi>Siarica,</hi> and another vnder the Hamme, called <hi>Poplitica,</hi> the fourth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the little Toe. and next, called <hi>Renalis.</hi> And it is to be noted of theſe foure great Veynes in the Legges, of the manifold dangers that might fall of them as oft it happeneth. There bée many other branches which a Chirurgion néedeth not much to paſſe vpon. The Sinewes ſpring of the laſt Spondell, and of <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> and paſſeth through the hole of the bone of the Hippe, and deſcendeth to the Brawnes, and mooveth the Knée and the Hamme, and theſe deſcend downe to the Ankle, and mooue the Foote, and the brawnes of the Féet mooue the Toes in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as is declared in the bones of the Hand.

In the third and fourth wards be foureteene, called <hi>Digitori:</hi> and five called <hi>Pectens,</hi> of the extremities of the Toes, next to the Nailes. And thus be there in the Foote, ſixe and twenty bones, with the Legge from the Ankle to the Knée, two in the knée, and one round and flat bone, and in the Thigh, one. And thus you ſhall find in the whole Leg and Foote thirty bones. And this ſhall ſerue for young Practitioners.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough there be a very excellent and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Bath within the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> yet for all that, I reckon that there are many in the North parts, which being diſeaſed with ſore diſeaſes, would gladly come to the Bath of <hi>Bathe,</hi> if they knew that there were any there whereby they might be holpen, and yet know not whether there be any in the Realme or no.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99028:47"/>Wherefore, ſéeing that I have writ of the Baths that are in forraigne Countries, therefore I thought good to ſhew the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of our owne Bathes: For if they be able to helpe mens Diſeaſes, what ſhall men néed to goe into farre Countries to ſéeke that remedy there which they might have at home.</p>
               <p>The Bath of <hi>England</hi> in the Weſt Countrey, in <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet</hi>-ſhirs, in a City called in Latine <hi>Bathoma,</hi> and <hi>Bathe</hi> in Engliſh, of the Bathes that are in it. This City of <hi>Bathe</hi> is fiftéene miles from <hi>Welles,</hi> and fiftéene miles from the Noble City of <hi>Briſtowe.</hi> The chiefe matter whereof theſe Bathes in this City have their chiefe vertue and ſtrength, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my judgement is Brimſtone, and of my judgement are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other, which have examined them as I have done, when I was at the Bathes with a certaine man diſeaſed of the Goute, I went into them my ſelfe with my Patient, and brought foorth of the place next vnto the Spring, and out of the bottome, flyme, mud, bones, and ſtones, which altogether ſmelled evidently of Brimſtone, if that a man may judge the matter of the effect, may gather that Brimſtone is the onely matter in theſe Bathes, or elſe the chiefe that beareth rule in them: for they dry vp wonderfully, and heale the Goute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently, and that in a ſhort time, as with divers others, one <hi>Miles Somelines,</hi> one of my Lord of <hi>Sommerſets</hi> Players can beare witneſſe: which things are no light tokens that Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone beareth the chiefe rule, ſéeing that neyther by ſmelling nor taſting, a man can féele no other matter or Mines to raigne there.</p>
               <p>If there be any thing lightly mingled with the Brimſtone which I could not perceive, it muſt be Copper: for whileſt I walked about the Mountaines, out of the which the Bathes doe ſpring, I found here and there little pieces of Marqueſteth and ſtones, mingled with Copper, but I could by no ſence or wit perceive, that the Bathes had any notable quality there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: then ſéeing that there cannot be found any other Minor or matter, to be the chiefe ruler in theſe Bathes then Brimſtone,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99028:47"/>we may gather, that theſe Bathes are good for all thoſe diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which all learned Phyſitians write, that all other Bathes, whoſe chiefe ruler is Brimſtone, are good for.</p>
               <p>

The Bathes of brimſtone ſoften the ſinewes, ſwage the payne that a man hath in deſiring to goe oft vnto the ſtoole, and when he commeth, he can eyther doe little or nothing. They ſcowre and cleanſe the skinne: wherefore they are good for the white Morphew, and blacke, for the Leproſie, and for all Scabs and Scurffes, for old ſores and bot<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agricola</hi> in his Bookes of thoſe things which flow out of the earth, writeth thus of Bathes of Brimſtone. The Bathes of Brimſtone doe ſoften the ſinewes and doe heate, they are good therefore for Palſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, for places pulled in too much, or ſtretched too farre foorth: for the ſhaking or trembling of any member, and they ſwage ache, and draw out Swelling of the limmes, and driue and ſcatter them away. They are good therefore for the Gowte in the hands, for the Gowts in the féet, and for the Sciatica, and all other diſeaſes in the ioynts: they ſwage alſo the paines in the Liuer and Milt, and driue away the ſwelling of them both: they ſcowre away freckles, and heale Morphewes, and Scabbes: but they vndoe and ouerthrow the Stomacke. Then ſéeing (as I ſaid before) our Baths of <hi>Bathe,</hi> haue their vertue of Brimſtone, they that are diſeaſed in any of the aboue named diſeaſes, may goe thither, and by the helpe of Almighty God be healed there.</p>
               <p>When thoſe Bathes haue of long time béene knowne, euen about a thouſand yeares, eyther the vnlearnedneſſe, or the enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99028:48"/>of the Phyſitians, which haue béene in times paſt, is greatly to be rebuked, becauſe either for lack of learning, knew not the vertues of theſe Bathes, or elſe for enuiouſneſſe, would not ſend the ſicke folkes, whom they could not otherwiſe heale vnto the bathes, for all men can tell, very few in times paſt haue béene by the adviſe of the Phyſitians ſent vnto the bathes, but now in this our light and learned time, after that ſo many learned Phyſitians haue ſo greatly commended theſe bathes, I doubt whether the niggardly liberality, or the vnnaturall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe of the rich men of <hi>England</hi> is more to be diſpraiſed which receiving ſo many good turnes at Almighty God, now after that they know that the bathes are ſo profitable, will not beſtowe one halfe-penny for Gods ſake vpon the bettering and amending of them, that the poore, ſicke and diſeaſed people that reſort thither, might be better and ſooner holpen when as they are there. There is money enough ſpent vpon Cockfightings, Tenniſ playes, Parkes, Banquettings, Pageants, Playes, and ſeruing onely for a ſhort time, that pleaſure of times, but of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſons which haue no néed of them, but I haue not heard tell that any rich man hath ſpent vpon theſe notable bathes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo profitable for the whole Common-wealth of <hi>England</hi> one groate theſe twentie yeares.</p>
               <p>Hée that hath béene in <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and had ſéene how coſtly and welfauoredly, the bathes are trimmed, and appointed there in divers and ſundry places, would be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that any ſtranger which had ſéene the bathes in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne lands ſhould looke vpon our Bathes, for he would thinke that the ſtranger would accuſe vs Engliſhmen of thrée things, of groſſeneſſe and brutiſh ignorance, becauſe we cannot trim our Bathes no better: of vnkindneſſe, becauſe we doe ſo light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regard ſo high and excellent gifts of Almighty God: of beaſtly filthineſſe, becauſe we make no partition betwéen the men and the women, whilſt they are in bathing, but ſuffer them contrary both vnto the law of God and man, to goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like vnreaſonable beaſts, to the deſtruction both of body
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99028:48"/>and ſoule of very many.</p>
               <p>If there be any liberall Duke, Earle, Lord, Knight, Eſquire, or other gentle, or no gentle honeſt man, that will beſtow any coſt vpon the bettering and amending of theſe Bathes, I will for my part, becauſe I haue no ſtore of other riches, helpe the matter as forward as I can with my counſell, which is this.</p>
               <p>Firſt and before all other things, my counſell is, that every Bath haue an hole in the bottome, by the which, the ſtopple ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, the Bath ſhould be cleanſed and ſcoured euery foure and twenty houres, at the leaſt once, and that I would aduiſe to be done at eight a clock in the afternoone, that againſt the morning it might be full of freſh and wholeſome water againſt the time the ſicke folke come to it in the morning, and ſo ſhould they be a great deale ſooner healed of their old diſeaſes, and in leſſe jeopardie in taking of new, which may eaſily come vnto a man, if he goe into a Bath, wherein a ſicke man, namely if hée be ſicke in a ſmiting or infectiue diſeaſe, hath continued.</p>
               <p>It were alſo méete, that euery Bath had a Couering about it, or at the leaſt it ſhould be ſo builded, that in the time of foule weather it might be couered; Notwithſtanding I would leaſt ſuch places ſhould be open, that the Vapors might goe out, that they that haue ill Heads be hurt with the Vapors which are too much holden in. I thinke alſo that it were neceſſary that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Lofts ſhould be builded right over ſome part of the firſt or principall Bath, that honeſt women and other which would not gladly be ſéene in the Baths, might euer haue (as often as they need, Freſh water drawne vnto them) through an hole, wherewith they may haue to bathe themſelues in Veſſels of wood, made for that purpoſe: Provided with all foreſight, that not one drop of the water which they in the Lofts haue occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fall in againe into the principall Bath, but be conveyed out by ſome other conuenient way.</p>
               <p>For the bringing of this matter ſurely to paſſe, it were beſt that the Lofts ſhould be ſo builded, that onely a Bucket might goe downe into the hath, ſaving that little portion (whereby
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99028:49"/>water may be drawne vp through, to ſerue them that are in them, and ſuch a fit place might be deviſed to draw water through, that it might ſerue for halfe a dozen Chambers aboue, or moe. This were alſo neceſſary, that in one of the Bathes, ſhould be builded ouer the hotteſt place that there is, a little houſe, after the manner of a Seaffold, very néere vnto the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, after ſuch a manner, that the hote Vapor might ſtrike hote vpon certain places of mans body; For this manner of reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the hote vapors, is much better for ſome kind of Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies or Govets, then the water it ſelfe is, therefore theſe things is not to be forgotten. This were alſo neceſſary, that not onely certaine ſeuerall bathing places ſhould be appointed for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alone, but alſo that others ſhould be appointed for ſuch perſons ſeuerally, as are ſicke in ſmitting, infectious, or horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, becauſe Almighty GOD hath ſhapen and made Hearbs, Stones, Gummes, Mettals, and Medicines, of diuers other things, principally for Man. It is to be thought that his Will is, that the ſame ſhould ſometime ſerue ſuch Creatures of his, as man cannot well want: wherefore as it is well done, that Hearbs and Medicines made of divers other things, ſhould be giuen to the Beaſts that ſerue us: ſo that I thinke it were not amiſſe, if that we made the Bathes after they haue ſerved man, for whom they were principally made, ſerue alſo to helpe Horſes: for performing whereof, I would wiſh that one or two Bathes in ſome convenient place, might be drawne out from one or two of the hotteſt Bathes, and then would I haue ſo deuiſed, that the Horſes that haue diſeaſes in the Legs and Ioynts, might ſtand in the Bath almoſt vnto the belly, and that other that haue other diſeaſes, might ſtand higher in the water: which thing may eaſily be brought to paſſe; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe Counſell of learned and wiſe Phyſitians is, that they ſhould not at any time goe into any Bath, to ſéeke remedy for any ſickneſſe, except it be ſuch a one that almoſt the learned Phyſitians diſpaire of the healing of it: if God haue ſmitten you with any diſeaſe, before you goe

                  </gap>all into the ſame againe. This Counſell is agréeing with that which is written in the <hi>38.</hi> Chapter of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus;</hi> in this manner. My Sonne in the time of thy ſickeneſſe, faile not (but that thou pray to Almighty GOD) for he will helpe thée: Leaue off all ſinning, and ſhew out thy ſtraight Hands, and cleanſe thy Heart from all ſinne, and deale Almes, and then giue place to the Phyſitian, and let him come vnto thée, as one that God hath ſent vnto thée. And a little after he doth plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that Sickneſſe commeth from the puniſhment of ſinne, where he ſayth: Hée that will ſinne againſt his Maker, vſeth to fall into the hands of the Phyſitian. As Chriſt in the fift of <hi>John</hi> doth alſo meane, when he ſaid unto the blind man he had healed, <hi>Goe and ſinne no more, leaſt worſe things chance vnto thee.</hi> Howbeit, wée may judge no man to be a greater ſinner then another, becauſe he is oftner ſick then common ſort be: for God ſendeth vnto good men oftentimes ſickneſſe, not for the ſinnes they haue done more then other men, but to kéepe them in good order, that the fleſh rebell not againſt the ſpirit.

               <p>But whether Sickneſſe come for to puniſh ſinne, or to hold a man in good nature and obedience, all Sickneſſe commeth of God: Wherefore, for whatſoever cauſe it commeth of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yée aske any helpe of any worldly Phyſitian, yée muſt make your Prayers to Almighty GOD; (as the good King <hi>Ezechias</hi> did,) and if it be méet for you to be healed, you ſhall be healed as he was.</p>
               <p>Then after yée haue confeſſed your ſelfe vnto Almighty
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99028:50"/>GOD, and to ſuch as yée haue offended; in the Name of God Aske counſell of ſome learned Phyſitian who is ſent of God, and not of ſome ſelfe-made Idoll, who is onely of himſelfe: if hée can (vſing all the lawful meanes commonly w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Before yée goe to the Bathes, in any wiſe yée muſt goe to ſome learned Phyſitian, and learne of him, by the helpe of the telling, what Complexion you be of, and what Humour or other thing is the cauſe of your diſeaſe, and there after his Counſell, vſe ſuch Dyet as ſhall be moſt fit for your Complexion and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Let no man enter into any bath before his body be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or cleanſed after the aduice of ſome learned Phyſitian, for if any man goe into the bath <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <p>If that he be counſelled to goe twice on a day in the bathe, he muſt ſée hée goe not into it, till ſeauen houres be paſt after your dinner, and tarry not ſo long in it in the afternoone as you did before.</p>

               <p>When you come out of the Bath, ſée that yée cover your ſelf well that yée take no cold, and dry off the Water on your bode with warme cloathes, and goe by and by into a warme bed, and ſweat there if you can, and wipe off the ſweat diligently, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſléepe, but yée muſt not drinke any thing vntill dinner time, except yée be very faint: then yée may take a little Suger-candy, or a few Raiſins, or any ſuch thing in a ſmall quantity that will ſlake thirſt: for <hi>Galen</hi> in the <hi>14 De Methodo meden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> commandeth that a man ſhall not eate nor drinke by and by after the Bathe, vntill he hath ſlept after his bathing.</p>
               <p>After that yée haue ſweat and ſlept enough, and be clearely delivered from the heate that you had in the Bathe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Bed, then may you reſt and walke a little, and then goe to dinner; for by meaſurable walking, the vapours and windineſſe that is come in the Bath is driven away.</p>
               <p>If the Patient cannot walke, then let him be rubd quickly, and if he can ſuffer no rubbing, then at ſome time it were good to take a Suppoſitorie, either of roote or of a béete, with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Salt vpon it, or a Suppoſitory of Honey, or a Suppoſitorie of a Flower deluce, or of ſalt Bacon, or white Sope.</p>
               <p>After all theſe things, then ſhall you goe to dinner, but you muſt neither eate very much good meate, nor any evill meate at all. Wherefore you muſt riſe from the Table with ſome good appetite, ſo that you could eate more if you would.</p>
               <p>The meates that are commonly of all Phyſitians allowed that write of Dyet that belongeth to Bathes, are, Bread of one dayes baking, or two at the moſt, well leavened, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baked, ſmall Birds, and other birds of the fields and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines that are of eaſie digeſtion, but Waterechanters yée muſt not touch, Kids fleſh, Veale and Mutton, of a Lambe of a yeare old, new laid Egges, Pheaſants, Partriges, Capons, Chickens and young Géeſe. The meates that are forbidden, are ſalt Béefe and Bacon, Pidgeons, Quailes, Pyes, and Paſties, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99028:52"/>ſuch like meates, Cherries, and all ſuch fruits, Garlicke, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and all hot ſpices, and all cold meates, as are the moſt part of Fiſhes: howbeit, divers may be well allowed, ſo they be well dreſſed.</p>
               <p>Milke is not to be allowed much: but if that the Patient be ſo greedy of it, that in a manner he long for it, then let him take it two houres or thereabout, before hée take any other meate, and he muſt drinke after it.</p>
               <p>White wine that is ſmall is allowable, or Wine being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed with the third or fourth part of ſodden water, according to the Complexion of the Patient: Some vſe to ſtéepe bread in ſtrong Wine, when as they can get no other Wine.</p>
               <p>Beware that in no wiſe yée drinke any water, and eſpecially cold water, and ſo ſhould yée forbeare from all things that are preſently cold, namely, when yée begin firſt to eate and drinke. Let therefore both your meate and drinke be in ſuch temper, that they be not cold but warme, leſt when as yée are hot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by your bathing and ſweating, the cold ſtrike ſuddenly into ſome principall member and hurt it.</p>
               <p>They that are of a hote Complexion, and of an open nature, and not well faſtened together, ought not to tarry ſo long in the bath, as other ought that are of colder and faſter complexion.</p>
               <p>If that any man betwéene meale times be vexed with thirſt, he may not drinke any thing, ſaving for a great néed he take a little Barley water, or Water ſodden with the fourth part of the juyce either of ſowre or milde ſwéet Pomgranates, with a little Suger: a man may vſe for a néed, a little Vineger, with Water and Suger, if he have no diſeaſe in the Sinewes, nor in the Ioynts.</p>
               <p>A man that is very weake, or accuſtomed much to ſléepe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner, an hours and a halfe after that he is riſen from the Table, he may take a reaſonable ſléepe.</p>
               <p>All the time that a man is in them, he muſt kéepe himſelfe chaſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> from all women, and ſo he muſt doe a moneth after, after the counſell of divers learned Phyſitians, and ſome for the ſpace
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99028:52"/>of forty dayes, as <hi>Pantheus</hi> and <hi>Aleardus</hi> would, namely, if they come out of the Chauldron.</p>
               <p>It were méete that in euery foure and twenty houres the Bath ſhould be letten out, and freſh water received into the pit againe, for ſo ſhall you ſooner be healed, and better abide with leſſe jeopardy, abiding in the Bath.</p>
               <p>It is moſt méete for them that haue any diſeaſe in the head, as a Cathaire or Rhemne, comming of moyſt cauſe and not very hot. For them that haue Palſies, or ſuch like diſeaſes, that they cauſe a bucket to be holden over their heads, with an hole in it, of the bigneſſs of a mans little finger, about foure foote above their heads, ſo that by the Réede or Pipe made for the nonce, the water may come downe with great might vpon the mould of the Head: if they haue the Cathaire, and vpon the nape of the necke, if the Patient be ſicke of the Palſie, or any ſuch like diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>The clay or grounds of the Bath is better for the Dropſie then is the water alone: it is alſo good for ſhrunken ſwelled, and hard places, and for all old and diſeaſed places, which cannot well be healed with other medicines: The matter is, to lay the grounds vpon the place, and to hold the ſame againſt the hote Sunne, or a warme fire, vntill it be ſomething ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d, and then to waſh away the fouleneſſe of the Clay, with the water of the Bath: this may a man doe as oft as he lift. Some Phyſitians counſell, that betwéene the bathings, when a man is twice ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vpon one day, in the time that the Patient is out of the bath, to vſe his plaiſtering with the Clay: but if the perſon be any thing weake, I counſell not to goe twice into the Bath, but either once, or elſe to be content with the plaiſtering of the mudde or grounds of the Bath.</p>
               <p>It were good wiſedome for them that cannot tarry long at the Bathes, either for heate or for cold, to take home with them ſome of the grounds, and there occupie it as is afore-told.</p>

And if hee be impedite, there ſhall be many Sickneſſes according to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and his houſe, that is the ſixt houſe.</p>
               <p>As for example, be it in caſe that <hi>Saturne</hi> is Lord of the ſixt houſe, and ſome Earthy ſigne is in the ſame houſe, the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> moſt commonly the ſickneſſe of that yéere, ſhall be of like nature, that is cold and dry. And ouer this you muſt conſider, whether the Lord of the ſixt houſe hath any aſpect with the Lord of the houſe of Death; to him, then moſt commonly the end of thoſe ſickneſſes that are cold and dry, ſhall be death.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe, as it is declared of the entring of the Sunne into <hi>Aries.</hi> So muſt it be ſayd of the conjunction of the Sunne and Moone through all the yéere, marking euery nature of the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:99028:145"/>Planet being in the ſixt houſe. If there be any, and the aſpects to thoſe two houſes aforeſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo conſider, whether this entring of the Sun into <hi>Aries</hi> or any of the conjunctions of the Luminaries, be in the eight houſe or no, for then it ſhall be much worſe. Note alſo, that if the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe of the Sunne or Moone be in any Angles of the Nativity of any perſon, or in any of the Angles of the revoluſion of his Natiuity, then he ſhall ſuffer ſickneſſe according to the nature of the ſame Angles. And if the Eclipſe be in <hi>Medio C<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>li,</hi> hée ſhall ſuffer hurt in his honor and fame. And if it be in the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he ſhall be grieued in his body, and ſo forth of the other houſes. But it ſhall be the worſer in caſe the Eclipſe be in the aſcendent, eſpecially if it be the Eclipſe of the Sunne, for that is the more dangerous of the two. For aſmuch as the effect of the Eclipſes of the Moon is alwaies finiſhed in the ſpace of one yéere at the moſt, ſometime in leſſe, and for the moſt part in thrée moneths. But the effects of the Eclipſe of the Sunne is very long or it come to paſſe. Sometimes twelue yéeres, as <hi>Ptolome</hi> in his <hi>Centiloquio</hi> witneſſeth.</p>
               <p>The Aſtrologians take the judgement of the yéere, by the entring of the Sunne into <hi>Aries</hi> in the firſt minute. And if it then happen, that all the ill Planets be in the eight houſe, which is the houſe of Death, they ſay; that yéere ſhall ariſe a Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and divers other ſickneſſes, according to the nature and conditions of thoſe Planets. And if the Moone in the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, be néere vnto the conjunction of the Sunne, that is to ſay, within two, or thrée, or foure degrées: That yéere ſhall be a death of Peſtilence Vniverſall, and that ſhortly after that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction; eſpecially at the comming of the Moone and evill Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets to infortunes: and as the infortunes be, the effects ſhall ſo appeare, be they more or leſſe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, you muſt conſider the great conjunction of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in the 13 degrée of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> as it was in the yéere 1625, in the laſt of Auguſt, which coniunction changed from an Ayrie triplicity into a watery, and it was in a watery
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:99028:145"/>Signe, whereof there chanced very much raine, and thereupon followed exceſſiue humectation and moyſtning of mans body, which by and by turned to putrifaction, and thereupon enſued many perillous and corrupt Feauers, Peſtilence and Agues, as <hi>Philerus</hi> and many others haue related, ſpecially becauſe the coniunction of <hi>Saturne</hi> was exalted in the North aboue <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which <hi>Saturne</hi> is of ill influence.</p>

Neither is it lawfull nor convenient to ſléepe the ſame day that the Veyne is opened, if any féeleth himſelfe infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with an Impoſtume, then let him altogether refraine ſléepe and prevent it by walking, for in ſléepe, heate inwardly induceth the Venome vnto the Heart, and other Spirituall Members, in ſuch ſort, that ſcarce any Hearbe may revoke the ſame ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome vnto its former eſtate, which thing hapneth not, as long as a man is in motion.</p>
               <p>But it may bée ſome men will aske, of whom is ſléepe to be avoyded? What if he ſhould haue a continuall ſléepe? To this I briefly anſwer, that in the time of Peſtilence, if any haue an appetite to ſléepe preſently after he haue eaten any thing, then ſuch deſires ought to be vindered for a ſpace, eyther in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or Fields for an houre, and then with naturall ſléepe the body may haue for one houre its naturall refection and reſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith; That if a man will ſléepe, he ought to drinke a good draught before his ſléeping, becauſe in ſléepe he attracteth and draweth many humours, and thoſe euill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are repelled by the humour of a good draught: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if a man ſhall aske, when a man is Infected how hée ought to know it. To this I ſay and anſwer, that a man that is infected, the ſame day he ſhall not eate much; becauſe he is repleat with euill humours, and preſently after Dinner he hath a deſire to ſléepe, and perceiueth a great heate with coldneſſe, hée hath great paine with coldneſſe, and hath great paine in the former part of the head, but all theſe are put away by mooving hither and thither, and for to walke hée is not able by reaſon of ouermuch vnweldineſſe and ſluggiſhneſſe of body, for a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

Therefore the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt remedy is, if a man perceiue all theſe tokens in the time of Peſtilence, that he ſhake off ſléepe as I haue ſaid before, for as by the reaſons before alſo alleadged it is manifeſt, that in ſleepe the Spirits vitall doth reſt, but the venome is ſcattered, through the membrands from one place vnto another, as I haue often obſerved. This being truly marked, when a man findeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe infected, as ſoone as poſſible may be, let him let blood in as ample manner that he almoſt faint thereon; for the taking of ſmall quantity of blood ſtirreth vp the venomous quality more forcibly. If a man will not cut many veines at once, then hée ſhall ſuffer to goe over the ſame veine incided as before ſaid, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto the retardation and ſtaying of the Blood.</p>
